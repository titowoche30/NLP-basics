This is a very well written and entertaining novel.  I was quite impressed and intrigued by the way that this solid storyline was developed, bringing the readers right into the world of the story.  I was engaged throughout and definitely enjoyed my time spent reading it.I loved the character development in this novel.  Da Silva creates a cast of high school students who actually act like high school students.  I really appreciated the fact that none of them were thrown into situations far beyond their years, nor did they deal with events as if they had decades of life experience under their belts.  It was very refreshing and added to the realism and impact of the novel.  The friendships between the characters in this novel were also truly touching.Overall, this novel was fantastic.  I can&#8217;t wait to read more and to find out what happens next in the series.  I&#8217;d definitely recommend this debut novel by Da Silva to those who want a little YA fun with a completely unique & shocking storyline.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review.","03 30, 2014",A1E5ZR1Z4OQJG,"Pure Jonel ""Pure Jonel""",An amazing first novel,1396137600

I feel bad for what happened to her in London so I cheered when she finally let go her rage and went for Angus' throat in the story! It was a long journey for her to get to that stage, she'd had a lot of healing to do but when she let go of her fear and attacked him I couldn't help the smile on my face!I loved how patient Grayson was with her throughout the book, helping her heal. I also loved that we seen another side of Alex and Maya when they were dealing with Honor at the start but my favourite thing about Ridgeville was how they all came together to help Honor in any way they could. The chemistry between Grayson and Honor was amazing and they certainly built the sexual tension between them until Honor was ready to mate with Grayson. She had some demons to face before she could be in the right headspace to mate with Grayson without freaking out!I hope there are more Ridgeville books as there are a few characters we didn't see (two we heard mentioned, one who appeared and a new character I'd like more off) that I'd like to see get their HEA, like the Mastin sisters and Stone as well as Deuce's sister too.","06 3, 2014",A1WR5OUT03E3M8,S.

I loved the humor that was infused throughout the book. I laughed out loud, and shed a few tears. (not the norm for me, especially the laughter) The author was able to give me a book that I didn't want to put down until I finished, and what truly surprised me was that I enjoyed reading it a second and third time, normally, I am not one to even watch a movie twice. (I did that as a beta reader to give the best feedback that I could, but really enjoyed it each time discovering nuances in the story that I'd missed the time before.)

1589267109,Books,"[2, 3]",2,"This book seems to create strong feelings in all who read it. It certainly came to me highly recommended. My husband and I read this book along with the companion workbook with 4 other couples, and it was and arduous journey. For our group of Christian couples in happy marriages, there was just too much that did not apply to us. Sure, we each picked up a handy tip here and there, but it wasn't enough considering the length and repetitiveness of this book.I agree with the basis of Eggerichs' main point in this book: If she gets the love she needs, she will give him the respect he needs, which will cause him to give her the love she needs. You get it - it's the cycle of love and respect. I gave it to you in one sentence instead of 24 chapters. If this book was about a third the length, I probably would have rated it at least 1-star higher.Every time our group met after the first time, we felt like we were struggling to get something new out of what we had read. The workbook is even worse. The questions are extremely verbose restatements of what is already written in the chapters, and there are a lot of them. Each couple would need to invest a couple of hours into each session, only to feel like we were trudging through the same material each time.We were also disappointed by the lack of scriptural references. Though the book is loosely based on Ephesians 5, the author rarely includes scripture in the chapters and more often uses letters from happy Love & Respect retreat participants as teaching tools. Our group was hoping for more Biblical discussion than what we got.If your marriage needs work and you and your spouse have trouble supporting each other and understanding each other's point of view, this book may help you. If you are looking for a good small group discussion book for a group of happily married couples, I would urge you to pass.

There may be some things that seem odd or are hard to understand to you,...BUT.... But, the designer just may have had some information that you as a builder or operator are not privy to.The same applies to most of &#34;us&#34;. Dr. Lieberman clearly describes how we came about and how far we humans have drifted away from the designers intent. We enjoy escargot but avoid worms and most insects. Our ancestors would not have turned their noses up at either...raw.And and how that drift has caused us some pain and suffering. His terms are &#34;Mismatch&#34; and &#34;Dysevolution&#34;. We have come so far in fact that &#34;changing back&#34; isn't always easy.Lieberman stresses two things, diet, and exercise. Our cousins, the Chimps and Gorillas spend much of the day walking and searching for food, they chew a while, sometimes rest a while and then start over. Walking is good! I believe he states it is almost as good for our bodies as running. At 82 I like that! Sometimes running is good, especially when a hyena or wild dog becomes interested in you. If it's a Cheeta or Leopard you're in big trouble.Actually some food can be better for us by cooking. Meat is easier to chew and now what we eat rarely has fur in it or fleas or maggots, which probably would have been eaten.The book is written for &#34;us&#34;, it is easily understood by laymen.

His book ""Voice of conscience"" is a real masterpiece and I enjoyed reading it to the core of my heart. This book ""Road to Siran"" comes as a sequel to his previous work. He stimulates the reader by evaluating the characters in such a way that it gives the readers a feel of freshness.The story starts with the old reminiscence of Erin from JFK international Airport and from where the author's writing took off with a momentum. The Character Erin is represented as a person with great interest on Ballet dancing and reading books. Her fathers death had made a strong imprint on her mind which resulted in exploring to know more about her Dad. Another character by name Elicia, friend of Erin is portrayed in a memorable way, she often changes her boyfriend and comes out as an high energetic character. The communication amid Erin and Elicia in the high school brings out our own memories during those good old days, they were depicted as naughty and  gets captivated to their opposite gender. The righteous Turkish Ozcan, very pretentious in nature to whom Erin got attracted at their first introduction.The author brings in equal mixture of Romance and thrill in his book, especially the non-verbal communication between Erin and Ozcan is a unique way of illustration .

I am glad I did.While I did not love it, my lack of love was based on the total lack of a likeable character. The only redeeming value of the main character and narrator was the love he had for his daughters. The writing is superb with a well thought out and suspenseful plot.  I was somewhat confused by the ending--not sure if the author just did not know how to tie up everything and resorted to resolutions that were just unrealistic or whether his ending was calculated to show that even the narrator's love for his daughters was not real and that he was therefore just as despicable as the other characters.","07 3, 2014",A184TZN9UC2EZC,loriltx,If you're looking for a warm and fuzzy read-this ain't it!,1404345600

(Didn't know Coach Bryant was such a scholar on Roman philosophy, but that's another story for another time, another review perhaps!!!)Luck does come when preparation meets opportunity, preparation as defined by 10,000 hours work hard work and preparation, opportunity--and the traditional defintion of luck could figure in here--by when you were born. Not so much where you were born or into what economic circumstances you were born, but by the time of year that you were born.  In academics and athletics, for example, being born just days or weeks past the deadline for  admission or participation, could give a young person the significant advantage of having another year to develop mentally and physically thereby putting him/her a year ahead of others  enrolling or beginning participation at what is technically the same time.  This is defined by Gladwell as opportunity.Oh, luck does pay a part, such as who made the first computer availabale to Bill Gates, but it wasn't so much who or when as much as what Gates did with that computer, how hard he worked at it.  Some things are beyond one's control, but most things are not--if you are willing to work hard and, as Bryant would say, sacrifice along the way.Not necessarily a quick read, or an easy read, but a good, thought provoking read.The Epilogue is, by far the best part of the book, but to appreciate it, really and fully appreciate it, the other nine chapters must be read first.

Surrounded by blueprints and plaster dust, though, she finds herself drawn into the story of a group of idealistic university grads from thirty years before, who'd thrown off the shackles of bourgeois city life to claim the cottage and rely only on each other on the land.  But utopia-building can be fraught with unexpected peril, and when the fate of the group is left eerily unclear, Lila turns her attention to untangling a web of secrets to uncover the shocking truth of what happened that fateful year, in order to come to terms with her own loss and build a new future for herself.I was literally glued to the pages of this book.  I just couldn't take my eyes off the pages for even a second.  The story was solid, the characters well fleshed out and original and the surprises just kept coming.

Despite all the mixed reactions people have had to the New 52, I've been hearing a lot of great things from people I trust about this new take on Wonder Woman. But I was still on the fence so I waited until my library got a copy of the trade. Now after reading I feel like an ass for waiting for so long, because it is awesome.Wonder Woman has always been a blending of mythology and the DC universe, but Azzarello takes it to the next level. While some mythology and DC purists might not like the changes, I loved them. On so many levels.First, the feel of this story has more of a mythological atmosphere. It reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series. We're dropped into the story, with a narrative that sounds right out of folk tale and action befitting a flagship title for DC. Yeah, this is a Wonder Woman title, while many people view her as a diplomat and peace keeper, they forget that she is also an Amazonian princess, equal in strength and power to Superman. In this story Diana doesn't hesitate to kicks ass and takes name.The story is compelling, the art is stunning, but above all that, this is a Wonder Woman I can relate to, as well as admire. She is bold, conflicted, and rightfully so. The very foundation of her existence is shaken. Everything about how she viewed herself, and her mother changes in this story, and still Diana stays true to herself and her mission.This is a dark story, lots of bloodshed, death and raw humanity. Which is right up my alley. The supporting cast is great, and diverse in very surprising ways (I LOVE Chaing's take on all the goods, especially Apollo). Gods like Hermes, Apollo and Eris are deeply involved in the story, along with the very human character Zola, who plays a big part in the story. Zola is awesome, she delivers a lot of fantastic lines that made me laugh out loud, but is also very sympathetic. She didn't ask to be thrown into the middle of a godly power struggle, but she does a great job of coping with all it.I also love the look of Diana in this book. Yes, she still has the hour-glass figure of the classic Wonder Woman, but she is taller, and broader. She looks like an Amazon of legend. She also fights like a warrior, gets in the action. Chaing does a fantastic job with action shots, and her design. Giving us enough of the old to keep her familiar, but with a whole new take on everything from her costume, complexion and stature. Paired with Azzarello's fantastic storytelling, we get a great example of a what a reboot can do. This team does it right.I can't recommend this book enough. Even if you've never read comic books, if you like Wonder Woman, mythology, or just stories featuring kick ass women at the helm, you should give this one a try.","04 30, 2014",A3IF0Q601XT0Y1,"The Fangirl ""Jeanne""","A New Take on Wonder Woman, and I love it!",1398816000

0399166181,Books,"[14, 16]",4,"There are a number of just-turned-30,or 40,or 50 humor books out there, and almost all of them have their engaging aspects. They do display a considerable range of styles, from the purely jokey to the angsty and way too self-involved. This book is a nice antidote to those two extremes because it is at times both funny and insightful in a rueful and self-deprecating way.  By that I mean Ms. Gurwitch knows her way around a one-liner and around an extended goof of a story, (see ""AuDum at the Apple Genius Bar""), but she also has a handle on wry commentary on the state of the recently 50. The emphasis is on wry commentary - there's no over the top hysteria, no relentless kvetching, no excess. We all get older, and some of the stuff associated with that is funny, or at least can be given a good-humored spin. That's what's going on here, and it is all done with honesty, a keen eye for the absurd, and a grown up appreciation of people and their foibles and preoccupations.  So, if you'd like a gentle, humorous reminder that you aren't alone as you hit 50, this could be a very nice choice.Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book in exchange for a candid review. Apart from that I have no connection at all to either the author or the publisher of this book.","03 6, 2014",A2AIE9DO5QSVBD,"Pop Bop ""Pause and Reflect""","Hits the ""G"" spot; Glib, Generous and Good",1394064000

This book is so much more than just the story that Holczer has written.  It is an absolutely beautiful book, full of wisdom and sadness, and hope.Grace is twelve years old when her mother dies in an accident. It has always been just the two of them against the world. Grace's father died before she was born, and although she knows she has a grandmother out there somewhere, she has never met her.  Grace's mom and grandma didn't see eye to eye on things when Grace's mom was pregnant with her, and she left town, never returning.  The two move often, not really allowing themselves to settle in any one town.But now that her mom has passed away, Grace is being sent to live with her grandmother, a woman that she is sure she is not supposed to like.  Her grandmother's life feels far from the one she was accustomed to living with her mom.Grace continues to want to live in the Before....before the accident, not the After.  Her grief is still new, and as she tries to mourn the loss of her mother, she is also adjusting to a new school and her grandmother, who doesn't seem nearly as horrible as she anticipated.Grace learns a lot about life and about love and about moving on.  Holczer's novel is so beautifully written.  There is an important message within this story, and although I just finished reading this myself, would love to start over again so I can enjoy the wisdom that is imparted in its pages.This is a novel I will be recommending to everyone from my middle grade readers to my adult friends.

It's focus on geometric patterns will appeal to budding engineers, mathematicians and architects, and the strong emphasis on battle strategy will appeal to fans of strategy games.  Other than that, The Rithmatist is a pretty formulaic YA fantasy. Protagonist, Joel, is in a permanent funk because he cannot study to become a rithmatist. His only friend, Melody, is despondent because her family legacy makes her feel she must become a rithmatist, and she doesn't want to be one. Author, Brandon Sanderson, is famous for his creative vision of magic and his infusion of magic in his stories, and this true in The Rithmatist. The mythology around the magical 2D creatures is almost a bigger part of the story than the events of the rising action.  Luckily, the last third of the novel all elements come together for a nail-biting, scary crisis and climax.

Even though I am not quite finished with this book, and still have a few pages remaining, I wanted to go ahead and write the review because I have learned and enjoyed so much during its reading. In fact, as soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to go finish the book.I grew up in a home, church, and social circle that viewed all forms of alcohol as ... well... evil. When it was mentioned that someone was drinking or that someone drank occasionally or socially, it was absolutely appalling. I am not sure how much of this was because of actuality or because of my perceptions of the situations where drinking was encountered, but it was a definite no-no to drink in any way, shape, or form.When I got older, I began encountering people that caused my views to conflict with the reality around me... in other words, I was meeting people who were clearly steadfast Christians, but they would drink occasionally or socially. My worldview didn't allow for this. In fact, many of the drinkers that I met were by far more dedicated to the cause of the gospel than the teetotalers that I had known. So I did what any good Christian would do... I shunned them and ignored these conflicting worldviews. WAIT! NO! I went to the Bible to determine the truth! What I found was quite different than what I had &#34;known&#34; growing up. My views needed adjusting.When I eventually encountered Drinking With Calvin and Luther!: A History of Alcohol in the Church by Jim West, which was a Christmas gift from my wife, my views had shifted appropriately and were fairly solid now on what the Bible actually teaches concerning alcohol, but were still hazy on the practicality of these new views. This book served to solidify those views, and give me direction on how to practically apply those views. It is a very Biblical book, but what was absolutely surprising to me was the actual history of alcohol in the church, which this book does an absolutely amazing job of bringing to light.I have a great respect for church history. I believe that it is important what Christians have believed historically. This is why I am a big supporter of reading and learning from historical documents, creeds, and books. Like Paul writing to Timothy, I am often saying, &#34;Don't forget to bring my scrolls!&#34; (2 Timothy 4:13) ... well for me ... &#34;books!&#34;  I mean, really, who am I, or who are we to believe that the last 2000 years Christians have gotten  it wrong? In fact, tracing the beliefs that have stuck can be extraordinarily enlightening. The amount of historical information and quotes that Jim West shares from remembered and respected Christian leaders through the ages was extraordinary. It never felt cumbersome reading this book, but I did find myself often wanting to quote different portions of this book. Especially those encounters with quotes from Martin Luther, like:&#34;Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and women. Shall we then prohibit and abolish women?&#34;~Martin LutherJim West also confronted the different teachings of the prohibitionist's views by going directly to the scripture. He displayed an amazing knowledge of the topic from the historical, the Biblical, and even the opposing view points. If you are actually interested in learning what the Bible teaches concerning alcohol, then I recommend this book. If you want to learn the Church's historical stance concerning alcohol, then I highly recommend this book.I would like to point out in advance, as a Pastor myself, that there were many members of the clergy, through the ages, that were paid ... not just monetarily, but with kegs of beer for the purpose of entertaining.

One thing I find particularly appealing about Eloisa James is her uncanny ability to describe a person, not just their looks but their feelings as well and in this book she did not disappoint. Her description of India's reaction to a particularly condescending marriage proposal is a case in point, ""Aggravation marched up her spine like a troop of perfectly dressed soldiers.""Both India and Thorn are strong characters, exceptionally good at what they do and accustomed to being in command, so when they get together sparks fly. A particularly witty exchange of letters early in the book in which neither backs down but both clearly enjoy the correspondence hints at the relationship to come. Despite their strength of character and despite their stubbornness both India and Thorn are vulnerable, largely due to difficult childhoods yet it is those hard starts to life that have shaped them into what they are. It is those vulnerabilities that made me warm to them.I found this book hard to put down. I found myself sneaking a few chapters when I woke in the middle of the night and struggling to stay awake so I could reach the end, yet also wanting to carry on living with the characters, and I guess that's the mark of a good book.

He ends up being a successful writer who spends time in Hollywood.  The main character is somewhat interesting-he is a tough, streetwise guy who has a high literary aspirations.  He sees himself as being very straight but many readers may not agree with his view of himself.The book starts out with an incident in Las Vegas casino where I have no idea what happened since I don't gamble but the narrator becomes friends with a man named Cully.Then it proceeds to tell the narrators struggles as a beginning writer, living in the  housing projects and working for the civil service.  This part I found interesting in part because I know many civil servants and people who live in housing projects.The narrator gets fired from the civil service then works for a famous writer named Osano.  This part of the book is boring.  We don't know much about Osano except that he wants to win the Nobel prize in literature and lives like a pig.  While we don't know what makes Osano a leading figure in US literature but we do know about his numerous personal failings.  This part of the book is bad.The best part of the book is the ending where the narrator goes to Hollywood and to me the book ended with a punch.  Some of the books stories of Hollywood life were excellent.There are some parts of the book that describe the workings of Las Vegas which I also thought was outstanding.","06 27, 2014",A131XH3HIR93TW,cem,Parts slow and other parts outstanding,1403827200

So it was natural that I read her latest book. and was pleasantly surprised in the direction in which it took, a departure from pure crime to a more traditional novel. I am told that it is the first in a planed trilogy.It a novel with broad mature understanding that examines bonds people form: those between siblings, child to parents and vice-versa, to friends, comrades in arm, and even with four legged creatures. In this case the animals are primary horses. I know little about horses but my own dogs and cats provides me with a feel  how much a person can love and cherish an animal. However the size of horses adds an element of danger to the relationship as a horse can accidental or intentionally kill a person.The story centers around two families of the horse set, one that breeds and trains horses and the other who has a family business manufacturing transportation equipment for horses. There are a number of lesser characters that cluster around the families. The various threads of  relatioship quickly weave an interesting narrative filled with action and drama that should hold any readers attention. My hope is that Sally will be able to continue this trilogy.","01 28, 2014",A1KXDBPJI52CY2,"Richard Kennison ""Retired USAF""",A Different Sally wreight,1390867200

Every chapter seems to end with some variation of the line, '... and then we'd find the Panther.  And one of us would die.'  And there are 83 chapters.  I thought we were being set up for some alternate ending in which this did not happen, but DeMille is not John LeCarre (thankfully).  But the actual ending isn't all that satisfying.The author takes a shot at fleshing out the bad guy character early on, which was interesting, but then he just drops it and becomes repetitive.  The closer-to-home bad guy is a walking cliche.  John Corey's capacity to just be a plain jackass has grown beyond amusing here, and Kate Mayfield is given almost nothing to do.Almost all the action is packed into the last few chapters, and then, just when things got rolling, a sudden ending that wasn't worth the previous 500+ pages, basically reading about meetings.  The ending seems to leave open the possibility of a sequel, which could pit John Corey against one of his teammates from this book, whom he would secretly want to succeed.  Probably woouldn't be great.If you like this kind of stuff, and have already read the first four John Corey books, read any of the Sean Drummond books by Brian Haig instead.

Luna is witty, tough, proudly dysfunctional in a gleeful sort of way, yet honestly broken, too. And though she's got a lot of Buffy Somers in her - she's not the &#34;Chosen One&#34; with super powers or super strength or resiliency. She knows the demonic because it's haunted her since childhood. She can see demons, she can fight them,  but the only thing she's got up on regular human beings is her knowledge and association with demons, and that's it.The story's pacing is smooth, with easily-consumed, concise chapters, and the story moves right along. Yardley is very confident in telling this story, and making this world seem real.  Also, we get the sense that the supernatural world we're exposed to here is merely a fraction of what's to come, so if you like supernatural mythos/mash-ups like The Dresden Files or Supernatural, this might be a good fit for you, also.Finally, I do want to address the issue of some tense slippage, which I saw someone mention in another review (that ironically misused grammar in its title). There is a little tense slippage, between first person present and first person past. But experienced readers will realize these are merely blips that got overlooked in the editing process, and they in no way detract from the story at all. Even big NY publishers miss small things like. A proofing issue is not indicative of poor writing.Pick this up today, and join Luna on The Demon Patrol.

At best, I'd find one of those gems that sneak up on you. Blackberry Winter is definitely a gem.Blackberry Winter weaves together two different tales of struggles and loss. Vera heads to work one evening and when she leaves there is snow blanketing the ground and her son is gone. Claire's life is in pieces and it takes a snow storm to put her on the path to fixing herself. The stories are beautifully interwoven, constantly pulling at my heart and never giving a moment of rest.I did figure out early on most of how the characters are connected. I initially thought that knowing the big mystery would take me out of the novel. It didn't at all. I still needed to know how things got from point A to point B and all the little pieces in the middle.Vera's story had me in tears. The pain she went through is something no mother should ever have to go through. And to have it set in 1933, when times were dire or times were fantastic, all depending on how much money there was to your name. She worked hard to make life as good as she could for her son, and it was so easy to feel the love she had for him.Claire is going through her own heartache. Her world has been broken to bits and she's not sure how she's supposed to put it back together. When a May snowstorm hits and she comes the story of Vera and Daniel Ray, something in her compels her to dig the truth out. She needs to find out how Vera's story ends and I loved going on that journey with her.Sarah Jio is an author that hadn't been on my radar before.

The characters of Andi and Jackson are so deliriously sexy you can&#8217;t help but to root for them the whole way through! This book is full of fun, drama and super steamy!This book is about how two people who are distancing themselves from even the remote possibility of love can change if the right person comes along!Andi is young and beautiful but her once sense of hope at a happily ever after has been lost. After she caught her fiance cheating, her whole outlook on love changed. After regaining control of her emotions, Andi decided never to let a man hurt her like that again. Now, Andi plays a game . . . the kind that keeps her heart safe but her needs met. Andi keeps men for one weekend, 3 days, of fun and excitement then she is done. She gets all the fun she wants with no commitment and no disappointment. Then Jackson happened . . .Jackson is rich. successful, handsome and oozes sex! But, Jackson comes with his own personal relationship drama that has left him scared too. When he hears Andi offering her game up to a stranger in a bar he decided to play along. He is completely down for a weekend of fun with no emotional attachment at the end. The weekend started out super hot right from the start in the club office . . .But it does not take long into their 3 days for you to be able to tell that what they are feeling is more than sex. When the weekend ends and they part ways you desperately want more for them. When life throws them back together can they get past their past baggage and work on their present?This whole book had me enthralled.

That is how it is essentially portrayed in the media and the scientific establishment.Author Jonathan Wells, however, is anything but politically correct.  He portrays the debate as a conflict between two views of what is real.  On the one side are the Darwinists, protectors of a materialist creation myth which begins with the words ""in the beginning were the particles in mindless motion.""  And on the other side are proponents of intelligent design, most of whom would affirm John chapter one, ""in the beginning was the Word.""Not all I.D. proponents are Christians, but all are open to the possibility that nature may show the hallmarks not only of natural causes but also of intelligent causes.  This is decidedly a politically incorrect point of view, and with examples Wells illustrates the professional cost one may incur for holding it.By citing philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, he shows why the current Darwinian power structure is digging in its heels and refusing to consider evidence that does not comport with its materialist paradigm.  But if Kuhn is right, Wells has reason to be confident that even now we are seeing the beginning of a paradigm shift as the last and strongest bastion of nineteenth-century materialism - Darwinism, crumbles before the growing onslaught of the evidence.  Darwinism may go down kicking and screaming, but it will go down.","01 7, 2014",A2ZQG435OSH2GZ,Randy A. Stadt,The Heart of the Matter,1389052800

Sometimes he is one of the antagonists and sometimes he is a secretly sentimental.  In Suzan Lauder's debut novel, Alias Thomas Bennet, she places Mr. Bennet in a role he does not often have the good fortune to occupy &#8211; the role of hero!In this novel Mr. Bennet takes more interest and care in his family.  He doesn't make sport of or ignore his wife, and she in turn is a bit more sensible and economical.  He isn't careless with his finances and management of Longbourn, which results in a very comfortable living situation and adequate dowries for his daughters.  When Mr. Darcy comes to town, he finds the Bennets (especially Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth) to be very intelligent and pleasant company.  How do the improved manners and abundance of propriety in the Bennet household effect the illustrious Mr. Darcy of Derbyshire...Is Elizabeth still inferior?  Is marrying her still a degradation?What an originative take on Pride and Prejudice! I enjoyed seeing how the different dynamics of the Bennet family impacted the storyline, and the happy and congenial atmosphere around Longbourn was heartwarming to witness.  Much better than their usual disorder and disfunction!  I enjoyed seeing Mr. Bennet be active in his daughters' lives and take steps to protect them from Wickham.  While at times, I may have thought the Bennet family a little too near &#8220;pictures of perfection,&#8221; I overall enjoyed seeing them portrayed in a more favorable light for a change!What I loved most about this story was that it had a duel plot &#8211; besides the present-day story of Mr. Bingley letting Netherfield Park, readers learn about the traumatic experiences Mr. and Mrs. Bennet faced twenty years ago and how those experiences brought them together through periodic flashbacks.  For me, learning the secrets of their past and witnessing their falling in love was my favorite part of the story.  More so than the Darcy and Elizabeth  storyline!  (I know, how shocking, right?!?)  In fact, I would have loved to see more of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!  Especially Mrs. Bennet &#8211; if Mr. Bennet is this story's hero, I think she should be the heroine. :)Unique and enthralling, Alias Thomas Bennet is a wonderful choice for readers who want to see a different side of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!

The day she leaves her home to find work, she has an unexpected guest. Marco Black, from Nemesis Unlimited, has taken the job of trying to get her fortune back. Nemesis heard about Bronwyn's trouble from her former maid. They normally didn't help the nobility, but they were convinced that Bronwyn was worthy.They soon learn that Bronwyn's late husband's business manager stole the money to cover his gambling debts and travel to Paris to find him. After locating the man, they learn that he owes money to one of France's most ruthless crime syndicates, Les Grillons. Unfortunately, the business manager can't pay back the money he owes and is soon killed. Since Bronwyn and Marco witnessed the murder, they are now on the run from Les Grillons.Marco searches out a former associate of his for help. While running from Les Grillons, Marco and Bronwyn can't fight their attraction to each other and soon become lovers after agreeing that this would be a short affair. But what happens when their feeling start to run much deeper?I LOVED this story. You see bits of Marco in the other books in the series and knowing that he was a spy for England had intrigued me. His story did not disappoint me.Browyn was not your typical society wife. When she lost all her money, she didn't lose it. She had set a plan in motion when Marco swept in to help her find the missing money. Had she been the typical society miss, Marco would have never fallen for her. His background working with Nemesis has given him a dislike of the upper class. It said a lot to Marco that Bronwyn's maid was the one asking for help. She had to be someone special to inspire such loyalty from an employee.As with all the other stories in the series, the significant other seems to fall right into the life of Nemesis. The organization plays such a big part in their lives that the relationships wouldn't work otherwise. Because of this, these stories are not your typical historical romance with the relationships taking place at several society balls. If you are looking for that type of story, this book (and series) is not for you. But if you are looking for a historical romance with some adventure and mystery then this is the series for you. I'm really hoping that Archer continues to write this series as I just can't seem to get enough of it.Thanks go to St. Martin's Press via NetGalley for a copy of the book in exchange of an honest review.","06 14, 2014",A3PAK16C0K8PZ1,teach4173,LOVED it!,1402704000

I liked this one as well, and although they are two very different books, I have similar things to say about this one, which is that I enjoy her writing but am not really a fan of her plot twists.  This book has two plot twists; the first one takes place about halfway through and is fine, but the second one takes place in the final pages of the book and I could have done without it.  For a moment, it felt like the rug was pulled out from under me, and although the author put it back, it was rather jolting.  I think things could have accomplished it in a different way.

0671718533,Books,"[0, 0]",3,"Thanks to the Amazon class action suit about ebook price fixing, and a lovely $60 payout, I&#8217;m catching up on many, many Star Trek novels that I missed during the years when I wasn&#8217;t reading them for whatever reason.One such acquisition was the Star Trek: The Next Generation novel Dark Mirror, by Diane Duane. It&#8217;s TNG&#8217;s chance to experience the &#8220;mirror universe&#8221; we got to see on-screen in both TOS and DS9, and, as I expected it to be, it was well written, with a few moments that really delighted me.One was the introduction of the dolphin, Hwiii, a hyperstring researcher who &#8216;swims&#8217; through the ship in a sort of water skin. Another was when Data, meeting Hwiii, tilts his head for a moment and then &#8216;speaks dolphin,&#8217; because, of course he does.I liked that Geordi and Deanna were the initial away team to the mirror Enterprise, and that they both got to use the knowledge they gleaned both from study and experience. Some of my favorite episodes were when Troi actually got to be a psychologist, and in this novel, she uses that training as much as she uses her innate empathetic abilities.Similarly, Geordi&#8217;s incredible depth of knowledge is highlighted in this book, as he works, sometimes with colleagues, and sometimes alone, to figure out a way to save, not just the ship, but the universe itself.I&#8217;m not sure when this was originally written but it felt like early TNG-fic. Data is very &#8216;sciency&#8217; but doesn&#8217;t have as much depth as he does in later novels &#8211; even in later pre-emotion-chip ones. It&#8217;s obviously before the contemporary push for continuity within the novels, but it&#8217;s still an entertaining read.Trek fiction is my crack. This was a delightful fix.Goes well with Sashimi and tempura and Kirin beer.","04 8, 2014",AQTLSE2QDCO0M,"Melissa A. Bartell ""MissMelysse""","Uneven in places, but enjoyable.",1396915200

B00EHMFCPK,Books,"[0, 0]",5,"I&#8217;m quickly learning that Jessica Scott doesn&#8217;t play-what an intense book!  There is so much raw emotion, and battle scars in this book I feel like I need therapy!  Sergeant First Class Reza Iaconelli, where to start&#8230; My heart broke for him. He was pure male power wrapped up in a lot of personal demons.  I seriously had to catch my breath a couple of times with him.  He is full of contradictions.  Physically he is all male. Big and physically strong.  Emotionally he is living one day to the next trying to function as best he can.  He tries to be the best Sergeant he can for his soldiers.  He is sympathetic to their insecurities yet battles with how to adequately prepare them for the realities of war and military life.  Reza is a recovering alcoholic, he struggles everyday with his addiction.  He is also surrounded by soldiers that have the same struggles.  Aside from struggling with alcoholism he is also dealing with PTSD.  Reza came with his own scars before joining the military and we learn about his home life and how it shaped him.Captain Emily Lindbergh is the opposite of Reza, although she struggles with her own personal issues, she comes from a life of privilege.  Her father was in the military but she never personally experienced the life of a soldier.  She is trying to bring help to soldiers such as Reza and his men, but not everyone thinks this is a good idea or is very welcoming to her.  Emily was a fantastic character.  She tried to show the soldiers her commitment to their mental health and was often the target of military personnel&#8217;s wrath.  Emily is alarmed at the high number of suicides and tries to provide the soldiers with some psychological support.As a couple Emily and Reza where exact opposites yet perfectly matched.  Where he is physically strong and emotionally weak Emily is physically weak but emotional very strong.  They had excellent chemistry and I loved that they formed a strong friendship.  I loved that they each met the other where they were at.  Emily never tried to &#8220;fix&#8221; Reza she accepted and gave him the support he needed although at times did not want.These characters were so real, Scott really peels back all their emotions and gives us two very vulnerable people.  When I read &#8220;Back to You&#8221; I felt the same way.  The characters were both so imperfect and so real.  Ms. Scott really captures the damage that soldiers experience during combat, after, and before.Honestly, this is a tough read.  I put the story down a couple of times, not because it was not well written or interesting, because it was all of those; but emotionally very challenging.  The characters were worth it.  It&#8217;s not a light read but it does provide a very &#8220;unromantic&#8221; look at the hardships of war and military life.  Overall, I think I can say that I recommend everything and anything written by Jessica Scott.  She really knows how to strip down her characters and show us who they are.  After the emotional odyssey it&#8217;s beautiful to see Reza and Emily find their way together!  Another fantastic journey with Ms. Scott!!","02 10, 2014",ABN9NHYEJUN7L,booknerd,A-mazing / heart-ache/ with real people,1391990400

B00GL3RLXY,Books,"[0, 0]",4,"Mary Ann Rivers is a wonderful writer and the characters in this book, the second in the series, were well-drawn and likable. It's got delicious sexual tension as well. She is very close to being a writer I would automatically buy. There are just a couple things about her writing style that bother me a bit, but it may not be an issue for anyone else. One is that she over-complicates the internal  conflicts to the point that it's a bit too much and a little convoluted. I don't think I've ever had this problem with a romance novel, since too much depth is not usually a problem, but I think she could pull back a bit on that and give more plot and external conflicts. There was never much standing in the way of their romance except their own issues, which were real and compelling but got to seem like they were over-done to sustain them through the book. And she piled them on, not so much heaping too many things so much as examining them in-depth and in excruciating detail, in many different ways over and over. This leads to my second issue, which is way too much interior dialogue, characters dissecting everything that happens when we've already get it. Much of this could have been cut out so there was a better balance of action and dialogue and the more interior writing. This might just be the writer's style and I might still read her, but it felt a bit like an overly rich dessert. Both of these issues are even more present in the first book in this series, &#34;Live,&#34; which I did not finish. You want to eat it, you do eat it, but you wish it had been just a little lighter.","07 23, 2014",A2GB4KHB64U8R3,publish or perish,Mary Ann Rivers is a wonderful writer and the characters in this book,1406073600

I would rate the book 2.5 stars with a summary that the author has the beginnings of what could be an interesting series, but would caution that Creedor itself is an average stand alone novel that lacks a cohesive storyline.  In the first 20% of the novel we are introduced to characters and a plot that I assumed would be the basis for the rest of the book, but this is not the case.  After being introduced to Jarlord (obvious antagonist) and the wizard Vandalen (obvious protagonist), we move on to new characters and plots that end up taking shape and making some sense, but by that time the reader is at the end of the book.....which ends rather abruptly just as I felt like I was beginning to make sense of the story.I will admit that I am not normally an avid reader of fantasy or science fiction, so I was likely not as patient as I might otherwise be with what I considered a disjointed storyline that I had difficulty following at times.  Nevertheless, there is enough promise shown by the author of Creedor that I will likely invest the time to read the next book in the series to see the outcome of what happens to Slogar, Camdus and Mara along with whether Vandalen commands a more prominant role in the next book.","04 3, 2014",A2O9V69MXLDBN,"LonBoy ""Lon Bohannon""",Promising But Wandering Novel,1396483200

If you want resolutions to a number of plot lines, you have buy book 4.  There doesn't seem to be an expected date for that installment.I expect, at this price ($23 + audio), to find a beginning, middle and end to EACH book, not a bait and switch for the next installment.

It is written by a man for men.Unlike many books which suggest aggressive approaches, misdirection, and head games, this book considers the underlying psychological differences between men and women and suggests reasonable and sensible methods for bridging the gap. It focuses on meeting a woman's needs without compromising a man's dignity.The book touches on personality types, what is acceptable and not acceptable in dating situations. I found the discussion on how to use Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Transactional Analysis (TA) when interacting on dates extremely valuable. NLP and TA are used to build a sense of compatibility that improves your date's experience - they are classic sales techniques.I've now read the book a couple of times, and I will probably read it again. From discussions on when to walk away, and how to overcome barriers this book has shaped my thinking in a fundamental way and helped me be a better and more thoughtful dater.The author has my thanks for writing this book.

I absolutely loved it and was constantly surprised. Never a dull moment and I was instantly caught in the story and did not want to go to work lol!Some parts of the story was making me so sad and where heartbreaking. It almost made me cry! Other parts had me laugh out loud.Charachters:Ellie Holbrook is the heroine in the book and I loved her. She has a very rough past littered with abuse, drugs and so on. When she finds herself pregnant she is forced to grow up and she excels at it. She is so mature for her age and is awesome with her daughter Sophie. She is confident and knows what she want. She does not joke around and when she knows what she wants she goes after it.Nicholas Grayson is the ultimate douchebag! I absolutely hated him in the beginning. His attitude sucked and I could not stand him. He did what he wanted just because he could. No caring at all if his actions harmed others. Bleh! Selfish bastard! That was until he met Ellie. She started out as a bet and eventually became so much more. Nicholas started to realize that the front he had put up was not going to work with Ellie and she made him want to be better.Romance:There was a lot of romance and it was hot and sizzling! A bigger rollercoster I would have to look for. Ellie and Nicholas love story has so many ups and downs that you almost get dizzy. But it totally works and thats what makes their love so awesome. The can be so perfect together and other times they are a total disaster waiting to happen. As the book so adequately is called their love really is a beautiful disaster :)Action:Not much action as in real fighting but there was a lot of other types of action in the story. It felt like it was Ellie and Nicky against everyone else all the time.

1455519510,Books,"[2, 2]",5,"Brilliantly Written!  Epic!Awesomeness is not a good enough word to describe this brilliantly written story &#8211; No I think Epic would sum it up nicely.  This captivating story is filled with a humorous seductive romance that kept me glued to the pages and wanting to live in their world forever.  The author&#8217;s descriptive details of the Highlander&#8217;s country side and their clan&#8217;s leaves the reader with a breathtaking vision that will forever be melded into your heart.  The character&#8217;s chemistry and humorous banter will forever have you longing for more of their story.Edmund MacGregor is a man of his word and beliefs.  God-like example of David & Goliath, the metaphor is clearly a Highlander conquering and ending the Giants of Aristocratic Nobility&#8217;s political gains.  His presence bleeds sexuality with his stance and handsome features, but his voice and actions will melt your heart first with a wanting desire.Dedicated to his cause for love of country and keeping the English from signing a treaty that will unite Scotland under their rule, he can only come up with one solution and puts the plan in motion to keep the treaty from happening and that is to capture the niece of the Duke of Queensberry.  However, what he doesn&#8217;t anticipate is falling head over heels in love with his charming captive Miss Amelia Bell.  No his adventure turns into not only a win for Scotland but a fight for an unconditional sacrifice for love than to ever live without her.Amelia has got to be my favorite character of all time.  I absolutely loved her.  I never laughed so hard &#8211; I literally had tears coming out of my eyes with her accident prone actions.  She reminded me of &#8220;KANE - the demon of Disaster&#8221; from the series Lords of the Underworld where every time she touched something or went somewhere disaster followed her in a humorous way.Amelia truly captured my heart with her tender innocent demeanor.  She is one of those females that is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well.  Her loyalty and dedication to her family is unconditional but her love for true passion puts a few adventurous curves in her road to happiness especially when she meets her dreamy godlike &#8220;David of Goliath&#8221; Edmund.Tormented between having a life with a man of her dreams and with honoring her father&#8217;s wishes of an arranged marriage to Seafield - the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, a man she doesn&#8217;t love.  Amelia&#8217;s heart breaks knowing the sacrifice she must make in order to not ruin her father&#8217;s status among the English aristocrats.The story is full of adventure and lots of Highlander action making it a fast read.  The sweet and tender erotic romance had the perfect amount of teasing and playful love making scenes (3 Flames).  The happy ever after had me smiling and hugging the book with giddiness.I have to say that this is my first book by Paula Quinn and I am awed in amazement of how addictive her writing is.  The plot was perfect, the characters were brilliantly created, and the world building is one I could live in forever.  Paula Quinn you have gained a new fan and I look forward to reading more of your awesome work.  I highly recommend this read to all Historical Romance lovers.Excellent Read!","03 30, 2014",AV0WASU4N2PGD,Ronda Tutt,Brilliantly Written! Epic!,1396137600

1494807017,Books,"[3, 5]",3,"Never Been Ready is book 2 in the Ready series by J.L. Berg.  This is Leah and Declan's story.  Both of whom were introduced in When You're Ready.  If you recall Leah is Clare's best friend and a nurse at the hospital where Logan, Clare's new husband works.  Declan is a famous movie star and one of Logan's college buddies.  Leah and Declan have a one night stand in book 1 and book 2 pretty much starts a few months later.I'm not going to rehash the entire book or reword the synopsis.  I am going to tell you right off the bat that overall I thought this was a decent story.  Was it as good as book 1?  In my opinion, no, and I hope to tell you why I did and didn't like it.I thought the characters in Never Been Ready were well developed.  We get lots of insight on both Declan and Leah's upbringing as well as who they are as adults.  We learn what makes them tick, what makes the love and what makes them laugh.  Declan and Leah together on the pages are hot and steamy as well as light and fun.  There are even some poignant moments.  Those poignant moments are what I think J.L. Berg is really good at writing.I loved all the moments with Clare and Logan.  I missed them and I was super happy to have them back.  I also appreciated the introduction of Clare's brother, Garrett.  There were many obvious moments in the book where Garrett was being set up for book 3 in the series, Ready For You.This is the tricky part for me.  How to explain what I didn't like.  The only word that keeps coming to mind is lackluster.The premise of the story was good.  Leah's childhood plays an important role.  Logan's childhood as well is integral.  The way their two lives ultimately intersect is also really important and was well thought out.  There was even a shocking moment that gave me goosebumps.  Goosebumps are always good!!  I just felt like the journey to get to the good stuff felt forced and quick.  For instance there is a certain scene between an actress and Leah at an awards show.  I felt like that particular moment had absolutely no bearing on the story as a whole.  The story wasn't really about Declan as an actor and whether or not Leah could handle it.  There was also a scene near the end involving Leah's father.  It may have been an attempt to tie up loose ends.  Maybe even an attempt to open Leah and Declan's eyes.  Again, I thought it was unnecessary.  The story would have been good without it.  I didn't think Leah needed that closure.  I didn't think Declan needed that push.I felt this story had a much deeper meaning than a hollywood actor who sweeps a woman from an abusive home, off on a whirlwind relationship.  It was about two people broken and bruised by their parents, being able to come together as a couple and finding their way towards a future with each other.  It was about embracing the future and accepting what's in front of you.  Accepting who you are, what you're capable of and what you can offer someone in return.  This was a story about love, forgiveness, and hope.For as many times as I rubbed my eyes and scratched my head in frustration, I was however, also rewarded with those special moments.  This is where I love J.L. Berg's writing, there is so much potential here.&#34;But that kiss?  That kiss left me awe-struck.  It was earth-shattering in its simplicity, mind-numbing in its intimacy, and completely raw in its emotional depths.&#34; - LeahSigh....see?  That's beautiful right there.  Give me more of that and less fluff.  It's okay to have lots of angst, inter-mingled with funny and lighthearted moments, while still being able to give us beautiful lines.  I don't mind the insights into each others worlds.  On the contrary those are important for character development.  It's the other stuff, like the moment with the actress, or the box that Declan takes from the attic of Leah's childhood home, that doesn't reappear again until nearly the end of the book.&#34;Shit.  I'm going to cry again.  Why do I cry so much around you?&#34;&#34;I don't know, but I'll hold you every time you do.&#34;I remember when I read that part I had to stop and smile at my husband because that's something he would say to me.  Those are the moments I like to look for my stories.  The stuff I can relate to or dream about or swoon over.  There is a really good story here in Never Been Ready, it just didn't come together for me as a complete package.Should you read this book?  Absolutely.  It might not be my favorite but it's still a decent read.  I'm looking forward to learning more about Garrett in book 3.*A copy of this book was kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*","02 18, 2014",AAP1L4EJITOMS,"Adrienne Scales ""Nicely Phrased""",Declan and Leah are made for each other.,1392681600

I wanted to read this IR Romance &#34;Billionaire&#34; type book because there are so many available to choose from to read; and in my opinion, if you read 1 or 2 Romance &#34;Billionaire&#34; books then you would have basically read them all. This IR story by Ms. Skye has all you could hope for in a book: Sex, love, suspense, thriller, mystery, betrayal, comedy, romance, redemption, oh and a FINE Billionaire. Yes, it is all in these books. I also appreciate the way Ms. Skye gives us Camille and Kyle's POV. Camille is a Black woman looking for a new job. She has this great &#34;I can do anything&#34; attitude. She applies for a PA position in Kyle's company and get's it the job, even though the position was not what she expected it to be.

Here he presents a very good Loki story that delves into his personality and focuses on more than his jealousy of Thor.  I'm glad he didn't try to make him seem like a misunderstood hero but an actual villain with interesting motivations.  Seeing Marvel's Norse history, no matter how many times its retold, is always a treat.  The art by Sebastian Fiumara was very good, although slighty rushed at times.  The darker elements of the story looked appropriately grittier than more joyous scenes.  Overall, a very very good Loki tale.","04 29, 2014",A3CS4U2S7C6XW6,S.

That's as far as science can take us.  From that, Gordon-Reed takes bits and  pieces of folklore to create a glorified and highly exaggerated image of Sally Hemings.  Even if Jefferson fathered Hemings' children, one should not make too much of it. When his wife died, Jefferson was still a relatively young man, with powerful needs. It would not be unreasonable for a man to use one of his slaves to relieve himself, any more than it would be unreasonable for him to use a prostitute. By many contemporaneous accounts, Hemings had sexual intercourse with many men on the bustling, but cloistered, Monticello estate. Powerful men have powerful needs and weaknesses. Even so, this does not elevate Hemings to the level of having a serious, significant relationship with Jefferson, any more than Bill Clinton's dalliances are serious relationships. The Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings' bastards, if they exist, were nothing more than the product of  a sexual relationship of convenience. The book is worth reading, though, because Gordon-Reed does gather together in one place a great deal of Jefferson folklore, even if some of her conclusions are flawed.","02 17, 2014",A1OHITJZJSENCZ,"Marvelous Mal ""The Malster""","Interesting, But Biased",1392595200

0307984761,Books,"[1, 1]",4,"I must confess that I tried twice to read &#34;Middlemarch&#34; and gave up before I even finished the first book or section. There are many possible reasons why the novel never &#34;caught fire&#34; for me, and I think that one may have been my misunderstanding of Dorothea Brooke and her marriage to Casaubon. I would recommend Mead's book if for no other reason than it has inspired me to pick up &#34;Middlemarch&#34; and give it another try. Mead gives a believable interpretation of Dorothea's actions and motivation, as well as an analysis of each of the major characters. Yes, there are many of what we today call &#34;spoilers&#34; included in this examination of Mead's favorite book, so if you have not read &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; and wish to, be warned.In addition to discussing the characters and the story of &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; Mead looks at George Eliot's life as it mirrors the various aspects of the book -- youth and the desire and need to find one's place in the world; love and courtship; what constitutes a good marriage or a bad one; how to deal with an intimate relationship with another person; growing older, and eventually death. Mead's book has been called a memoir by some critics, because she does mention some pertinent parts of her own life, and some actual physical journeys made back to England to look at many of Eliot's haunts. However, Mead's life is only a very small part of this book -- most of it has to do with the life of the author of Mead's favorite book, the lovely and haunting writing style, the sly humor, and the pointed observations on the nature of mankind that came to fullest fruition in &#34;Middlemarch.&#34;I do understand an obsession with a particular book -- mine being &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; by John Galsworthy. I have read Galsworthy's masterpiece at least one in every decade since the 1960s (and sometimes more than once). As &#34;Middlemarch&#34; calls to Mead, &#34;The Forsyte Saga&#34; calls to me, and I find something new in it every time. Just as Eliot knew the heart of her characters, even the more unpleasant or unsympathetic ones, I found myself identifying with the same character (&#34;Soames Forsyte&#34;) as I became older. While Galsworthy was not happy that so many readers identified with Soames, Eliot seemed to understand and forgive the characters, such as Casaubon, who were less than perfect and who presented barriers to loving and being loved over and over.I think this book will appeal to many different sorts of readers -- those who share the author's love of Eliot and &#34;Middlemarch,&#34; those who appreciate a well-written book that examines an author's life and work, and those who want to pick up Eliot's masterpiece but have been afraid to do so for any one of a number of reasons.

Each chapter reads like that day's ramblings, not related to anything that's come before. Maybe he wrote this as therapy. Maybe he was bored by taking time off to rediscover his muse. (Btw, he found it. He recently played Carnegie Hall to some of his best reviews). Either way, this is Neil's mind, seemingly fully exposed. It's quirky, to say the least. And repetitious. This could have been cut in half. Still, you won't really mind because Neil really does have a lot to say, and much to recall of his storied career, which peaked by the early 70s. Yet, he's still creating great music, and his voice is still one of the wonders of rock. He is completely right in his crusade to upgrade the recorded music listening experience. Music did sound better before digital, and we have gone seriously backwards. He wants us to be able to feel music again. I hope the industry listens. Lossless digital tracks are coming for the masses. This is a worthwhile read for Neil fans.","01 25, 2014",A1P98DMX8YUSNW,Brad Smith,"Rambles, yes, but it's full of insightful nuggets",1390608000

Delicious. . . absolutely delectable!As a child, Portia had a dream to run her grandmother&#8217;s restaurant (The Glass Kitchen) in Texas; however, after settling for a different life (married to a senator which betrayed her with her best friend, and did not allow her to use her cooking talents); a life derailed, she finds herself divorced, and moving to Manhattan to join her two sisters, Olivia and Cordelia.Portia is sure she was responsible for her grandmother&#8217;s untimely death and gives up her passion of cooking, due to this misconception. She inherited the ancestral gift (a knowing about events thru food), and her Gram instructed her how to use her abilities, leaving some helpful cookbooks and tips (how to heal certain illnesses with specific foods, among other things).Portia escapes Texas, and moves to the Upper West Side in a rundown brownstone townhome (garden lower level apartment), she inherits from her Great Aunt Evie, filled with fond childhood memories. However, she has no job skills and no divorce settlement (her first job was a hoot)! Her two sisters have sold their share of the townhome, to the handsome investment banker man who lives upstairs on the upper two floors (Gabriel Kane). The other two sisters are not without problems either.Gabriel lost his wife a year earlier, and is raising two daughters, Miranda (16) and Ariel (12, almost 13), and things are not going well in this household--total dysfunction and lack of communication. He wants to buy Portia&#8217;s garden apartment; however, she does not want to sell as this is the only thing she owns.The last thing Portia wants is to get involved with a man and his daughters. She has problems of her own &#8211; like how to survive in NYC! However, the minute she meets this man &#8211; her food thoughts come back strong, and no matter how much she tries to escape, the more she is pulled into this world of food, cooking, and lust.However, fate steps in and forces Portia to do what she loves best in life &#8211; COOKING, as a means to support herself &#8211; working for handsome and complex Gabriel, while planning her test kitchen with the two sisters, sending aromas to the streets of NYC, while seeking investors for their desired new restaurant (The Glass Kitchen)--if they can find the capital. Some good comfort Texas food, gourmet style in for fast pace NYC&#8212;putting her cooking skills to work to bring in the customers (and investors).Of course, to really make it yummy, nightly midnight visits (down the fire escape)to the garden level, from the complicated, hard nose, but sexy Gabriel, with some irresistible delights and surprises.All is not rosy and uncomplicated in this Upper West Side neighborhood. There are many twists, and obstacles along the way in this messy family of Kanes &#8211;from Gabriel&#8217;s mother, his brother Anthony, Gabriel&#8217;s former wife, and mother of the girls, with a secret past and events leading to her death, which shake Ariel&#8217;s world, as well as Portia.With quirky neighbors (Stanley and Marcus), supportive sisters, hot sex, some strong women, yummy gourmet recipes, love of food and recipes for life, with a young girl&#8217;s determination to put her family back together, to one&#8217;s woman&#8217;s courage and journey to fulfillment and passion &#8211; a meal you will want to savor!Linda Francis Lee created an irresistible banter and chemistry between Gabriel and Portia, which will keep you smiling and rooting for this sizzling, yet odd couple. And oh, Aerial will melt your heart, with her intelligence and winning personality, as she finds her way.There are many parallels here, and would be ideal for book clubs or discussions. Portia and Ariel, are very similar&#8212;both are youngest of sisters, guilt ridden, undervalued by others for their intelligence, keen sense of humor, talent, style, and passion &#8211;both courageous and determined to make things better, as they discover their true self.From the inviting front cover to the delectable and mouth-watering recipes &#8211; a captivating novel of love, forgiveness, family, courage, and the determination to follow your heart and dreams.I was traveling while reading this book, and had to get up extra early, in order to finish THE GLASS KITCHEN, this morning before getting back on the road.

0785161759,Books,"[0, 0]",5,"There is so much good about this volume.  It is essentially split up into two parts, so I&#8217;ll take it one at a time.Part 1:  The continuing battle with Uncle Aaron:While Miles and Aaron team up together at the beginning of the volume, they inevitably battle, as Aaron&#8217;s blackmailing of Miles is finally resolved.  Frankly, I was shocked by how it was resolved.I haven&#8217;t mentioned this in previous reviews, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say that I really like the fact that Miles&#8217; power set is different than Peter&#8217;s old power set.  Sure, there are some similarities, but then there are also some drastic differences.  The camouflage and venom blast are especially awesome.From here on out, there will be spoilers until I get to Part 2.  The death of Aaron was tragic and necessary.  As the Prowler, Aaron is a villain, and an enemy to Spider-Man.  The fact that he knows Miles&#8217; secret identity means that he couldn&#8217;t have stayed in the story unless he turned good.  Aaron wasn&#8217;t on that trajectory, so he had to die, for the sake of the story and the character.  But how he died, accidentally being killed by his nephew, is so tragic for Miles, who now has to live with this as a 13 year old.  In an interest parallel, the death of Uncle Ben influenced the way Peter Parker would live as Spider-Man, and I&#8217;m certain that the death of Uncle Aaron will impact the hero that Miles becomes.  Aaron&#8217;s dying words, &#8220;How about that?  You are just like me,&#8221; will surely haunt Miles for years.  He will now have to look his father in the eyes knowing that he is responsible for the death of his father&#8217;s brother.Part  2:  Working for Captain America:Although I&#8217;m not reading any other Ultimate Marvel books, it is clear that there is a storyline going on in which some sort of war has started.  Captain America is leading the good guys, and Miles joins by their side.  This section, called &#8220;Divided We Fall,&#8221; opens with the words, &#8220;Washington is decimated.  The government is a mess.  The Southwest is in chaos.  States are seceding from the union.  America is falling apart.&#8221;  This sets the stage for Miles going to war, but not before an opening scene where Miles&#8217; father tells him (Spoilers) the bad news that Spider-Man killed his uncle!Spoilers from here on out.  As with previous volumes, Peter&#8217;s cast appears in Miles&#8217; story.  In this volume, we get a crucial interaction as Aunt May and Gwen Stacy decide that it is time for Miles to have something that Peter built.  Web-shooters and the web formula!  I have to be honest, with all the other awesome powers that Miles had, I failed to realize that he didn&#8217;t have the ability to go web-swinging.  This will be even better now!  Since Miles&#8217; best friend, Ganke, is really smart, and knows his secret identity, he is tasked with the mission of creating the web fluid using Peter&#8217;s formula.Ultimate Maria Hill makes an appearance in this volume, and quickly realizes a connection between Spider-Man and Miles&#8217; family.Back in the war, chaos ensues, and Spider-Man is a big hero.  I really like it when Miles can work with Spider Woman (Peter&#8217;s clone, but in female form), this volume had a lot of that.  Plus, there was further character development with Miles&#8217; parents.  Another great Spider-Man book.I read this volume right after reading volumes 1 and 2, and it was a good experience to read the whole story (so far) straight through.","01 16, 2014",A3NUMRC41CR0UU,Matt Anderson,Spider-Man teams with the Ultimates as the United States are torn apart,1389830400

0991401115,Books,"[1, 1]",5,"Time and time again, Aleatha Romig delivers superb stories full of emotion and suspense. Behind His Eyes - Truth is just another example of how Ms. Romig is at the top of her game and shows no signs of slowing down. Giving us Tony's POV is a huge treat, and helps us dive into the mind of this disturbingly, sexy, possessive man.In BHE - Truth, we are reminded, yet again, how powerful Anthony Rawlings really is. He is a man on a mission. He wants something he takes it. All throughout this story it's like you can hear him in your head, the anger, the desperation, everything this man feels, you are right there with him. Some might say we get so invested in this character, and we are so conflicted on how we feel about him, it can take a toll on us. I can certainly say, for a fact, that this series has taken a toll on me, in a bone-chilling, heart-racing, mind-****ing way, but I wouldn't have it any other way. These are the stories that stick with you long after you finish reading. It's what you start comparing all other books to. Nothing beats the raw emotion and intense feelings this series pulls out of you.Anthony Rawlings, Tony, Anton, Mr. Rawlings....no matter what you call this man, he will wreck you. He will make you hate him. He will make you feel sorry for him, and he will make you love him. This will go on and on, until you don't know what to think. No matter what you feel for him, the point is...you will FEEL.&#10077;She was his drug. Claire Nichols ran through his system like ecstasy, sending him on otherwise unobtainable highs.&#10078;In Behind His Eyes - Truth, Tony finally has to deal with circumstances beyond his control. That's not to say he won't try, but it's out of his reach. Conflicting feelings turn into clarity, and then to opportunity. Every little detail has it's reasoning. There are scenes that you appreciate getting a second look at. Maybe you will get some answers to some questions that have been on your mind. Maybe it will make you even more confused. No matter what, we get to see the two characters that we have fallen for happy again, even if for a moment in time. I'm pretty sure I said this in my last review of BHE - Consequences, but if you are an avid reader of this series, even though you know what's going to happen, it is still so **** intense!I could seriously go on and on about Tony. He is so incredibly fascinating. Some of you while reading this will have little smirks on your face at times. We get to witness Tony without control. He always has such an internal conflict when it comes to his Claire. The depth of his feelings for Claire is beautiful, yet a little scary, but it's nice to bare witness to such a gruff man come to terms with his love for another human being. For such a powerful man he has so many regrets. It's a little sick that I find some comfort in his suffering, but it reminds us that he is just a man.&#10077;He didn't want to be disappointed; however, more than that, he didn't want to disappoint.&#10078;So make sure you pour yourself a glass of wine, shot of tequila, or a whiskey sour, because this will take a lot out of you. Nobody can write intensity like Aleatha Romig. She is so high at the top of her game right now, I can't wait to get the final chapter in this saga. Here is to another fantastic addition to the Consequences Series, and here is to the man we all love to hate, Mr. Anthony Rawlings.*Gifted Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*","03 18, 2014",AUZ96COITGKE3,Shayna Renee's Spicy Reads,"Powerful, sexy, and thrilling!",1395100800

I wish that there were more adult dystopian books but again this one is a Young Adult read. Not that I have anything against it but really someone needs to write an awesome Adult Dystopian novel!Divergent has been on my TBR (To be read) list for a long time and I was able to borrow this book from my friend finally and read it and I am so glad I finally was able to read this book! I am giving it 5 stars! Veronica Roth writes so well, there is no draggy parts at all, it has everything I could ask for. First of all, I think something that all dystopian books must have to be a good read is good action, during Tris&#8217;s Initation in Dauntless she does a lot of gutsy things, she jumps on to and off of trains, jumps off buildings, and climbs the ferris wheel at the old Navy Pier and that is just naming a few, I won&#8217;t tell you everything because I do not want to tell any spoilers. Roth also describes the landscape of Dystopian Chicago amazingly. I am obsessed with Chicago and have been there 3 times in the last 6 years to visit and the way she describes the places in Chicago and where Tris and her family and friends are at I can envision so clearly. There is also romance but not so much that it ruins the book and the meaning behind the book. Tris and Four are such a different couple then in most books I read and at the same time I can identify with them a little bit. I do not really have one bad thing to say about this book. If you like dystopian novels go out and try this one. I am looking forward to going with my co-blogger Colleen to see the movie so we can disect it and write a review of the book vs. the movie for everyone!Thanks always for reading!RochelleP.S.

But I loved that MNSSSL was written in two point-of-views &#8211; Cat and Lucas. This was a great way to learn more about Lucas, who is a sweet and romantic guy! Lucas is also struggling with his relationship with his parents, so it is made clear the connection he has with Cat. It is truly fate that brings them together and they heal each other. MYNSSSL also focuses on Cat&#8217;s insecurities because of her mom, which at times I did sympathize but also felt like throttling her. Rather than focusing on all the negative emotions as a result of her mom, Cat really needs to look around and see all the good she has. I loved seeing Alessandra (Less) and Austin make small appearances in the story, but I wish there was more of them. Less and Austin are comedic and I miss them! I also loved getting to know Jenna. Maybe it&#8217;s because I am a mother of a teenager, but just seeing the bond Jenna and Cat have made was priceless.Overall I really enjoyed this book.

I have been known to enjoy the serial books that are becoming a &#34;thing&#34; but, I think this book would have been better off sitting a little bit longer and coming out as a full story and not pieced out. I feel that the serials are meant for very emotional, and raw stories. Fix You didn't accomplish that with me. It felt disjointed and very rushed. I could not bring myself to like the heroine, Olivia, she seemed childish, and naive. Whereas, Bash has so much riding on his job, and seemed to be a stand up guy for his family until Olivia makes him lose his head. It just didn't click with me. The story, the characters, their circumstances and their chemistry. Something just seemed off.That being said, Fix You does have the potential to grow into a book I would like to read. It did end on a mild cliffhanger which will probably intrigue me enough to move on to the second book. But the second serial is going to have to possess major growth where Olivia is concerned, and more explanation where her family is concerned, and build more on Bash and Olivia's relationship. The way part one ended, it just felt like a physical connection with no deeper meaning between the two.Again, I don't mind serials but they have to be done fantastically. This one was just so-so, and the fact that it was a serial on top of that just made it more frustrating than anything. I want to be left needing and wanting more. Fix You just left me perplexed and wanting it to have gone the extra mile and reach its potential.

0992106834,Books,"[0, 0]",4,"I really liked this second novel in the Limelight series by Elisabeth Grace! I enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline that Grace provided for us.Pacing: I felt this one was really well paced. Landon and Skye's relationship progressed quite well given their situation and Grace did a good job of keeping the story going without too many lulls or too much filler.Storyline: I really enjoyed this one. I do love the whole forbidden office romance going on and I liked that this storyline seemed to fall into place a bit more naturally than the first book in the series did. The story begins with Skye getting out of a messy potentially abusive relationship and starting a new job. She meets Landon Steele at a club one night and while she's not looking for anything more right now, she can't help the physical response he elicits from her. And then runs away. It made me chuckle because it sounds like something I would do! Unbeknownst to her, Landon is actually her new boss, which brings things to a whole new level of awkward and tense. Both know it would not be professional to have any kind of relationship, but staying away from one another is going to prove to be quite the task. Having to work closely together, it's only a matter of time before Landon and Skye give in. There was one obstacle thrown in I could have done without, as I felt it was added in to create more drama, which was unnecessary. There was already a more concrete storyline in place to add tension, and I felt that was good enough.Characters: I liked Skye and Landon. Skye is sweet and a bit of a seductress! She isn't actively looking to start anything else after getting out of her previous relationship, but things with Landon just happen and that kind of chemistry is just hard to ignore. She is close to her father and she doesn't want to do anything that will jeopardize his career, which is why she shoulders some things later in the novel on her own, instead of seeking help. She cares for Landon and doesn't want her mess disrupting his business, as he's worked hard to get where he is today.Landon is a great male lead. He's sexy, sweet, and dominant all in one. And man, do I love my dirty-talking boys! Landon could be a bit hard to read at times, but he is really a good guy who cares for Skye. He knows they should keep it professional, but working so closely with her does nothing to help his libido. Landon is very protective of Skye and he can't stand that her ex, Vic, hurt her. He refuses to watch another woman get crushed under the weight of a man, after seeing what his father did to his mother. He was the one to pick up the pieces and therefore, cannot let himself forgive his dad, despite his pleadings to see him and make things right.We also get to see Ellie, Mason, and Katie from Rumor Has It show up. Ellie and Katie are those girlfriends every girl needs in their life and I like that Grace included their friendship.Final Thoughts: Overall, I thought Picture Perfect was a great read. I liked seeing Skye and Landon's relationship develop slowly, as well as watch them fight the attraction they feel towards one another. Their scenes together were sexy and I didn't feel they were too over the top at all. There were a couple of things I could have done without, because I didn't feel they were necessary to fueling the plot. The storyline really did stand on its own, with their relationship, Skye's ex, and the matter of how important public appearance is to both of them.","06 3, 2014",A3NP9H53JZ4DR0,Jessica Leigh (Lovin' Los Libros),"Enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline Grace provided for us.",1401753600

141437934X,Books,"[0, 0]",4,"Goodreads Description- Raised in an Old Order Mennonite community, Rachel Stoltzfus is a strong-willed single woman, content living apart from mainstream society until whispers stir the moment her belly swells with new life. Refusing to repent and name the partner in her sin, Rachel feels the wrath of the religious sect as she is shunned by those she loves most. She is eventually coerced into leaving by her brother-in-law, the bishop.But secrets run deep in this cloistered community, and the bishop is hiding some of his own, threatening his conscience and his very soul. When the life of Rachel&#8217;s baby is at stake, however, choices must be made that will bring the darkness to light, forever changing the lives of those who call Copper Creek home.I was first drawn to this book by the cover.  I like reading novels about the Amish, as long as they aren't preachy, and from my experience they usually aren't.  However, this book was about Old Order Mennonites, which is a religion that I know very little about other then that they are similar to the Amish in their Plain ways.The Outcast is one of those rare novels that shines in many ways. I was immediately drawn in because &#8220;The Scarlet Letter&#8221; is such a favorite, and I was not disappointed. Every character, every sub-story, every generation, every relationship in the book, is layered and intricate and nuanced. The story seemed to start a little slow for me but once I was a few chapters in, I couldn't stop reading. Everything about the book took hold and wouldn&#8217;t let go&#8212;until I finished.  Even though the Mennonite community is completely foreign to me, Petersheim made it both fascinating but wholly accessible and familiar. In every scene I felt I was right there with her and every character.  Each word written had true meaning to the story.  There was very little that felt like filler.The story was written in two voices.  One was Amos who was Rachel&#8217;s sister's recently deceased father-in-law and the other was Rachel's voice herself.  Amos's voice served as an omniscient voice for both of his son's, Tobias and Judah, as well as the moral compass for the story.  His words were used as a commentary on the happenings of the book.  At first I was worried that using a &#34;ghost's voice&#34; was going to be distracting to the story, it turned out that his voice was truly the perfect compliment to Rachel's and a unique way to give voice to the brother's without devoting more chapters to each brother.  Petersheim's use of this device shows that she is going to continue to be a fantastic writer.  For an author to write in such a unique and difficult manner shows her writing maturity which will only grow the more that she writes.  One other complaint is that the book ended a little too quickly and I wish there was more information on how the book ending came to be and what happened to the family after everything finally settled down.  I would love to see a sequel to this novel because I was so wrapped up in the characters that I feel like they are real people to me.I highly recommend this book to others.  Give the book a chance and keep reading if you feel like the beginning is slow or confusing.  The author does a good job of sorting things out for the reader as the story goes on.  This would be a 5 stars book for me but I want to hold back a little because of the confusing beginning and the abrupt ending.  This is a solid 4.5 stars!

0199535663,Books,"[2, 2]",5,"Herodotus' status as the father of history is not an exaggeration. His panoramic and in-depth view of the people and the events made his Histories a comprehensive study that is rare in history. And he was a master storyteller too. The story he was telling here was the complex political disputes and long standing social feuds between Greek cities and Asian peoples that culminated in the Greco-Persian Wars.Of course any translated book is only as good as the translator and the editor. This happens to be an excellent one because neither the translator nor the editor tried to show off their classical Greek training or their convoluted scholarly skills. They simply presented this book in smooth and clear English which made the reading easy without the undue burden of constantly referring to the notes. In addition, the series of maps at the end of the book was immensely helpful.Traditional historians tend to take a serious and rigid position on their view of history as if it's the only perspective. Recently, some historians have tried to open up this narrow scope and try to interpret history from different points of view and have proclaimed their approach ""new history"". But Herodotus had beaten them to it because that's exactly what his Histories did.Even though he was writing for the Greeks, he showed great appreciation and understanding of Egyptian history and culture and often gave Egypt credit for many ideas and inventions later given to the Greeks. He also showed remarkable respect for their archenemy the Persians. In fact, a lot of our information of the early Achaemenids came from his writings. His open-mindedness and international outlook is astonishing. However, he couldn't resist giving Greek ancestors to the non-Greeks. Thus the Persians were descended from Perseus, the Medians from Medea, and the Egyptians from Io.Even though Herodotus lived in a city sponsored by Athens during the Peloponnesian Wars, he didn't seem to like the Athenians very much and praised the Spartans very generously. He tried to give dues and disclose warts when he talked about the conflicts between Greek city-states, personal vendettas among the leaders, reasons for frequent defections, and the wide spread collaborations between the Greeks and the Persians throughout this period. Not surprisingly, even though the Spartans helped the Athenians defeat the Persians in this round, two generations later, the Persians helped the Spartans defeat the Athenians.As this was a time before the fanatical intolerant monotheism took over the region and religious tolerance was the norm, Herodotus told the readers ""their Zeus is called XXX "" or ""their religious rite is similar to our XXX"" to relate foreign practices to Greek understanding. However, he wisely and steadfastly refused to engage in religious discussions beyond the necessary mentions of it as part of the cultural and political practice because he deemed it outside his chosen topics of history, geography, and culture.Some scholars complained that his writing was rambling but I find it very natural. He introduced each player when it was appropriate in the story and not before. He revealed each people, their history, their location, their customs, and their achievements as the flow of storytelling required.  By disclosing their origins and struggles, he gave roots to their unique culture and made their way of life reasonable and understandable. He was a master storyteller who knew when and how to take excursions and when and how to get back on track. With imperceptible forward momentum, he unrolled the story slowly and even-handedly towards its dramatic climax.Herodotus sprinkled a lot of traditional oriental wisdom, as dispensed by various wise men from different race, throughout the book. But it's often the small anecdotes which are most intriguing and lighten the reading. And some of the passing remarks are more than first meets the eyes. For example, his observation that the Egyptians had thick skulls because they shaved their heads and the Persians had thin skulls because they had long hair and wore felt hats is unexpectedly modern understanding of vitamin D from the sun thickens bones. And the bit about Xerxes' uncle explaining that dreams are not messages from gods but things we have been concerned about during the day is also surprisingly modern Jungian.Most impressively, he did not insist on his point of view. He shared other perspectives and other interpretations equally, even those information and stories he did not find credible. As he said ""I am obliged to record the things I am told but I am not required to believe them."" He trusted the readers to make their own choice among various versions.  Some scholarly historians called this gossiping, but I thought it was respect for the readers. After all, there are many sides to every person, many facets to every event, and many explanations to every outcome.Even though the West has taken the position that the Greeks had won because of the naval victory at Salamis, it was not so simple. Considering that the Persians had demolished Attica and burned Athens, and considering that Xerxes returned home when winter was coming, one could conclude that the Persian's expedition to punish Athens for helping the Ionians and for burning Sardis was mission accomplished. Besides, Persia was never a sea power like the Greeks were anyway. So, win or lose, it all depends on the spin!On the other hand, Herodotus did have the advantage of living in a highly cultured and civilized world of Eastern Mediterranean and was writing for a sophisticated and educated readership.  Later scholarly historians didn't have his advantage because they were living in the Western Mediterranean world after the onset of the devastating Dark Age and after it was under the intolerant grip of Christianity. Besides, his gift for storytelling is unique even among fiction writers much less among historians.","01 4, 2014",A2PASDJQR83CTV,Vimala Nowlis,Far Away and Long Ago Came Alive!,1388793600

Beautiful.Okay, now that I got that out of my system, let me just say that this was not what I was expecting AT ALL. The writing was beautiful. Lauren's inner monologues were beautifully written, although this girl annoyed me to no end. But I love characters who frustrate me. Isn't that the point? As the reader, I have the foresight/foreknowledge that Lauren doesn't so my frustrations with her weren't because she wasn't likable. I was frustrated because I was able to see the disaster coming (although, I COMPLETELY wasn't expecting it to be what it was) and she couldn't.I tried, but I just couldn't get myself to like Cal. Even after his whole secret was revealed, it didn't change how utterly repulsed I was by the way he treated Lauren. And then Lauren frustrated me further by defending him. By waiting for him. By putting her life on hold for him.She and Caylen deserve so much better. In the sequel, I really hope she and Chris get to know each other and fall for one another somehow, some way. I don't know why I feel that way since we didn't get to read much about Chris. I just do. Hopefully we'll have more insight into who he is in the next book.The suspense element of this story had me flipping pages and reading until the wee hours of the morning. I'm completely dragging my ass at work right now because of it. (Thanks a lot, Portia.) This book was suspenseful right down to the last page, and did I mention how beautiful Portia's writing is?

I had to see what would happen and what it would take for Mitch to come around and do right by Paige and his daughter.This book takes place approximately 7 months from the conclusion of the first novella. Believe it or not Mitch has not been home since he left and it takes a threatening document to stir him in to action.When back in town he wastes no time trying to establish a relationship with his daughter. Paige initially is shocked, then angered, then finds herself melting under the charms of Mitch. It is obvious the two still have feelings for each other.Both families have been very supportive of Paige and Bree. Everyone except Diane is leery of Mitch's actions regarding Paige. As one would guess the two find their way back to each other.I want to state that I love Kendall's writing and I was anxiously awaiting this book. Mitch does truly seem remorseful but I can't say I am happy with the ending. He screwed up in a major way, HUGE. I am ok with him trying to establish a relationship with Bree, but I cannot see how Paige gets past the abysmal way he treated her. Even when trying to work hard to get her back, the only thing that is conveyed crystal clear is his attraction and desire for Paige. Everything is very physical. His actions with Bree obviously are great but I don't see how he made any amends to Paige. Humbling himself with her family and Erin seemed inadequate and I really wish Paige sought something better.Then the crazy twist at the end, I knew something was fishy but I didn't have any clue it was gonna go down like it did. Not sure how I feel about that as it was thrown in last minute and not really dealt with. I am curious to read the next book however to see what happens between Josh and Erin.So overall, great writing, good story and characters which are believable. I just couldn't make peace with the whole situation though which is probably a personal issue. Plus what is up with Trent.

B00IE0T608,Books,"[5, 5]",5,"It&#8217;s not always easy for creative writers to develop believable characters for their short stories or novels. BUT This Novel Succeeds Brilliantly! It is Superlative and the Author here is a Master Artist at the Top of both his game and his Genre. Most of us don&#8217;t have close relationships with dashing heroes named or brilliant, beautiful female femme fatales who light up the Kindle or paper page in front of us. This makes it tempting to take inspiration from people we actually know. But this Fantastic book does everything for you! The resulting characters are Magnificent Creations here and not the thinly veiled versions of ourselves, our friends, and relatives. The Author is asking readers to visualize the characters and relate to them. They want the characters to be realistic so that the audience can connect to them. This Superlative Novel makes the reader want to cheer them on as they surmount obstacles and shed a tear when they fall. Gustav Freytag considered plot a narrative structure that divides a story into five parts, like the five acts of a play. These parts are the exposition (of the situation), rising action (through conflict), climax (or turning point), falling action and resolution. This book which grabbed my attention from the very first page to the very last is a masterful example of a perfectly created plot. I read the novel in one sitting! It was that good! Highly recommended! Great Buy! You will thoroughly enjoy it!

149600938X,Books,"[1, 1]",4,"~4 Stars~***I received a complimentary copy provided by the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review.***The Pairing is a companion novel to The Proposition and The Proposal. I would recommend reading the other two books first since Pesh Nadeem appears in The Proposal, so the story makes more sense if you know his background. Megan McKenzie is a single mom who is in the final stages of becoming a registered nurse. She hasn't dated since her son's father left her when she found out she was pregnant. Pesh is an ER doctor who hasn't dated seriously since the death of his wife years ago. You would think they would want the same thing in a relationship...love and commitment, but you would be very wrong. Megan wants a hot fling, and Pesh wants to settle down and give love another try. They are both chosen as godparents to Aidan and Emma's son, Noah. Pesh is a great friend to them, and Megan is Aidan's niece. When they meet at the baptism, there is an immediate attraction between the two, but it's going to be a battle of the wills to see which one gets their way, a relationship or just hot, smoldering sex! Megan leaves the reception with Pesh after she has too much to drink, and she thinks she will be having a night of hot sex with the sexy doctor, but things don't turn out quite like she had hoped. The two go their separate ways the next morning, but fate isn't through with these two, Megan is assigned to Pesh's ER to finish her final clinicals several months later. Let the games begin again...you'll have to read on to see if Megan or Pesh win.I have read the other two books in the series and loved them. I know reading reviews from other readers that many of them didn't like Pesh in The Proposal because they thought he was trying to take Emma away from Aidan. However, I have always been a fan of Pesh's. Who wouldn't be! He's sexy as hell, a successful doctor, a truly honorable soul, and again did I mention sexy as hell? He falls for Megan hard the first time he sees her and cannot forget about her. Megan is a firecracker. If you read any of the other books, you know she takes after her Uncle Aidan. She and Pesh are truly opposites who complement each other nicely. Megan brings out the spontaneous side of Pesh, and he brings out the softer side of her. There are many scenes that include Megan's toddler son, Mason. Those were some of the most heart-warming scenes to me, especially the one near the end of the book when they are eating dinner with Megan's family. Much of the story is about Pesh's pursuit of Megan and trying to get her to give him a chance at a real relationship. The sexy stuff doesn't happen until at least mid-way through the book, but it was well worth the wait. Katie knows how to write a sexy love scene!One of my favorite things about this book is that I got to see how Aidan, Emma, and many of the other characters are doing. I love Aidan and Megan's big Irish family! The epilogue was sweet and tied up things very nicely. I have read almost everything by Katie Ashley, and she has yet to disappoint me!","02 24, 2014",A35EH6VHW336ML,christie72,"Sweet, Sexy Love Story",1393200000

Here's where I get into how the whole series was for me.Book 1: Really good, I definitely liked it!Book 2: GREAT - I LOOOOOVED William's POV and all of the crazy, totally unexpected revelations!!Book 3: Meh, it's had it's good moments, but overall didn't excite me a whole lot.This Book: Okay, even though I didn't LOVE the third book, I had REALLY high hopes for this one, considering how much I loved William's POV in book 2! Unfortunately, I spent the whole book waiting (again) for something dramatic to happen, and it never did. Once again, everything seemed almost sugar coated and sort glossed over.******** SPOILER ALERT ********DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY READ THIS BOOK!Okay, so here are some of the specific issues that I had with the plot in Honor & Obey / Honor & Betray:1) What the hell ever actually happened to Abby? She was just one of many things that got brushed aside and never revisited.2) I can't possibly be the only one to think that the amnesia was a complete writing cop out (sorry Teresa, I love your work and really do think you're a fantastic author)!! I mean, COME ON! I was so damn intrigued to see how they would work through all of the craziness that, surely Emma was bound to find out about William. But I knew that somehow William would find a way to convince her that he really loves her, and win her back over, and their relationship would prove to be better and stronger in the end... Unfortunately, Emma STILL DOESNT KNOW THE TRUTH!3) William's parents. They rushed to his beside when they found out he was in a coma, brought in some phenomenal specialist doctor to work with him, then just peaced out and were never heard from again. Emma didn't bother to inform him that they had been there, nor did he bother to ask, and also, nobody bothered to even freakin' tell them that he was awake and at home, and his parents didn't even bother to so much as call to check on him either!!4) Emma was harboring so much hurt & resentment towards William through most of the book, and then *BAM* like the flip of a switch she's.over.it.and.they're.getting.married.THE.END there was no actual working through her hurt, no communication, openness, honesty. So now they got their &#34;HEA&#34; that seems doomed because their whole relationship is based on lies & deceit between 2 people who are trying too hard to be what they think that the other wants, rather than being who they really are.With all that being said, the series was good, and had TONS of potential for greatness, but the last 2 books were just too rushed and had too many holes in the plot.Also, I would have very much preferred to read the 2 books together, just written as 1 book, done in alternating POV's.Wow, that was really long winded, if you've stuck it out and are still reading this, thank you!","06 7, 2014",A1AU9U3UHD6K1B,"Suprstar311 ""Bethany""",SO.MUCH.POTENTIAL!,1402099200

Like water, we mostly follow the path of least resistance.&#8221;Seeing as Wally Lamb is my favorite author I was extra excited to read this book. It definitely did not disappoint. On the surface, this is a story of a broken marriage. Of a wife and mother of three who leaves her husband for another woman. If you have read some of his previous works, you already know that there is going to be so much more to the story. Pour yourself a large glass of red wine and keep the bottle nearbyThere are so many heavy issues that are dealt with in this story, divorce, sexual abuse, loss of a parent, alcoholism, the list goes on. I know this makes it sound like a depressing story but it&#8217;s not all bad. The real heart of the story is learning to cope with what life has given you and making the most of it. Buy another bottle of wine.The thing I love the most about his novels is the way everything is so layered. You have to pay attention to things that may seem insignificant at the time as it will certainly come full circle in the end. There is always some intertwined story that seems to not have anything to do with the rest until the end. This is not to say that everything gets tied up and placed in a nice package with a bow on it. Many things are just inferred and if you haven&#8217;t been paying attention you will miss out on these gifts.Annie Oh is an artist, a mother, and an ex wife and is about to be remarried. To a woman. Her husband Orion is left to deal with not only being left but being left for another woman. Their children are also forced to deal with aftermath of her decisions. Annie also has secrets from her childhood that have shaped everything she has ever done in her adult life. Things she has never shared with anyone. Not even her husband or her soon to be wife. Of course this only begins to scratch the surface of the entire plot of the story.This novel reminds me of the concept of the butterfly effect. One small action effects so many things. It is not until the end that we learn what started everything. I can honestly say there is not one thing I disliked about this story.

I also read the beginning, how the author was a busy mom who worked a night shift, trained Crossfit, and cooked for her family of four so I thought there would be a lot of easy practical recipes.I was disappointed to find that most of the recipes had a lot of ingredients, something the author complained about in other books. Many of the ingredients in recipes were also other recipes from the book, so for instance a chicken recipe may have 12 ingredients, one of which is bacon aioli which is 8 ingredients and another is cauliflower rice which is time consuming as well.I also wasn't crazy about the type of recipes. I'm looking for practical everyday meals, and I keep finding paleo books that try to recreate gourmet restaurant quality meals. The author is an admitted &#34;foodie&#34; and it shows. She lives in San Francisco and is a part of that restaurant scene, and she flies to cities or other countries just to try a restaurant. I don't do any of that. I'm just looking for stuff I can make for my family that's easy and good.

Its a romance, and also a puzzle with danger coming to Kate along with the solution.I liked Kate, she's mum to her dead sister's child, and she and Jamie have carved out a contented life for themselves. Then their world is turned upside down when tabloid papers print a story over Jamie being local hero and rugby player Lane's son. Of course as always they're not interested in the truth &#8211; just want scandal for the ratings. Kate is bombarded with Press at her home, Lane completely blind sided by the fact he may have a ten year old child, and Jamie struggling with insecurity wondering if he'll be taken from Kate...Kate's firm and insistent, nothing will take him away from her, though she's willing to let Lane build a relationship with him.Along the journey to the truth there's  a potential kidnapping, danger and attacks on Kate&#8217;s home and business, and threats to her safety. Lane steps up his protection of her and gradually falls in love. He just needs to persuade Jamie and Kate that they should be a family.Its a fun romance with a snippet of danger, not heart stopping but a more subtle kind that creeps up quietly and lands with a bang. The police were great characters too, becoming regular visitors. The protagonist didn't really come as a shock to me, but it was well done, and everything added up &#8211; I hate when we find out who the &#8220;baddie&#8221; is and it doesn&#8217;t fit the clues we've had, none of that here though. Looking back we can see how things build up to that dramatic climax and reveal.Priced at 0.99 for 228 pages its long enough to let the reader get into the plot. Its a bargain for lovers of gentle contemporary romance.Stars: Four, fun read but a one off for me.ARC supplied by Netgalley","03 28, 2014",A1X2URS71RRMMF,"Jeannie Zelos ""jeanie zelos book reviews""",sweet HEA romance,1395964800

Paranormal elements aside, if she were a friend, I'd subtly be showing her how unhealthy the relationship is and trying to convince her to end it.3.

1616953241,Books,"[1, 1]",3,"This novel was initially released in 1996 and has been re-released now for two reasons.  The first of which is the fact that the author, Magdalen Nabb, passed away in 2007 and it is an opportunity to continue having her work presented to a new legion of readers.The second reason is the recent revival in this true crime cold case that has brought about a non-fiction novel (with the same title) that was co-written by Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi.  That book has garnered interest from Hollywood and a film is speculated to be made starring George Clooney in the role of Doug Preston!The Monster Of Florence was the Jack the Ripper of Italy having been charged with seven double homicides between 1968 and 1985. There were many other murders that could have possibly been committed by this individual but local law enforcement has been unable to prove any of that.  Actually, they have not been able to prove anything and this remains the most infamous cold case in Italian history.Along comes Magdalen Nabb attempting to put a fictional spin on this case.  Her recurring crime series that featured Marshal Guarnaccia is the perfect outlet for a speculative novel about the famed Monster of Florence.  Like the actual officials following this case, Guarnaccia seems to be foiled at every turn and is surprised when his Director assigns him the task of reopening an old cold case such as this one.The novel contains many court transcripts and internal communications that reviewed the various suspects in this case --- and there are a lot of them.  Nabb blends both fictional and non-fictional suspects to present a case for Guarnaccia that appears overwhelming for anyone to solve.If readers have read the non-fiction novel by Preston & Spezi they will realize how inept, corrupt and misguided the Italian law enforcement and legal communities were in regards to this case.  Preston and Spezi themselves were even detained and briefly accused of being the Monster themselves!  A frustrating endeavor for anyone seeking to bring clarity and understanding to this case.THE MONSTER OF FLORENCE provides a lot of technical detail that at times bogs down the action and pace of the novel.  The main enjoyment in reading a novel like this rests in having an understanding of the actual case it was based on and appreciating the attempt to shine some light on a dark chapter in Italian history.Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader","01 9, 2014",A19O53R0L0W4O7,"Ray J.

It talks about being fearful of sleep paralysis and how meditation plus lucid dreaming helps to archive astral travel.The reason I'm giving it a 1 star is because the most critical element, according to the book, to actually being able to project, requires  &#34;sleep paralysis&#34;, and the book spends almost no time at all on how to achieve it.Here's a section on sleep paralysis:&#34;Is there a way to activate or consciously create sleep paralysis? I haven&#8217;t found a way to consciously induce it, however, there are several conditions which almost always lead to sleep paralysis. One is being on your back. Another is coming out of a lucid dream. And the third is taking a nap or going back to sleep in the middle of the night after you&#8217;ve been up for a short while.&#34;Here's the passage indicating that sleep paralysis is critical to the process of astral projection:&#34;The big moment has arrived. You&#8217;ve achieved sleep paralysis, your body is tingling, you hear the buzzing high-pitched sound of acceleration. You can see even though your eyes are closed, you&#8217;re sensing, seeing, and hearing other beings around you. Your astral body is activated&#34;In other words, without sleep paralysis I cannot astral project, and the book really doesn't spend any time on how to get me there. This was not helpful for me.

It's wonderfully illustrated, there's enough colour and pictures interspersed throughout to appeal to younger ages, but not to the point of being extremely juvenile so it can grow with them. This is a full version of the Bible, in the New International Readers Version (NIrV) which is a translation that uses contemporary english. I find it similar to the NIV.This Bible is hardcover, which is a big plus for durability. We have had one or two other Junior Bibles around here and the soft cover ones do not stand up well to regular use and going back and forth to church. The pages aren't super thin, I don't think they'll be likely to rip and the print doesn't leak right through making it hard to read. That seems to be a problem with some other children's Bibles because they are trying to do things cheap. Not a problem here. The only negative I have about this particular Bible is the lenticular picture on the front of the bible, the ribbed 3D kind of thing. I think it makes it look younger than it's really geared for and the age that would be ready for a full Bible. Besides that, young boys love scratching their nails across it!Overall, this is a great Bible choice for a boy or girl who is ready for a full Bible instead of a Bible story book. It's already got my 7 year old reading bits and pieces in his new Bible instead of feeling like it's way out of his league.

BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS is a departure from Harper&#8217;s normal vampires, werewolves, and witches, but it doesn&#8217;t suffer for it. In fact, this standalone was  a treat, and definitely worth the read despite my complaints about tropes.There were some truly creepy moments in BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS. Between the ghostly experiences, plus the &#8220;trapped on an island&#8221; plotline, there&#8217;s almost a horror movie feel in the background. I appreciated that the ghosts were scary, because the last paranormal romance with ghosts I read, the ghost was the heroine, and it just doesn&#8217;t seem right. Creepy ghosts are much more like it.My one complaint was the real-life bad guy. I think the book could have done without that addition, since there was already enough tension with the ghost story and trying to figure that out. Plus, the story was unique, and the addition of the stalker ex-boyfriend made it feel, at times, a little formulaic. I could easily see this novel without the ghosts being a standalone contemporary romance novel, so anything that made it feel more that way was a downside, in my opinion.All in all, BETTER HOMES & HAUNTINGS was classic Molly Harper, with laughs and romance and just enough paranormal to round it out. While it isn&#8217;t my favorite Harper, it definitely stands on its own merit, and since it isn&#8217;t a series, there really isn&#8217;t much investment required (though I wouldn&#8217;t mind a book about some of the other characters&#8230;).I would recommend it to anybody looking for a fun, creative romance read.","07 7, 2014",A1RMS2HHSYPH3,Kate,"Standard romance tropes make this not the best Harper, but fun nonetheless",1404691200

She has a murder to solve and somehow the past all comes together. The answer to the present is in the past.Now at times I got confused because the author would use the last names of the officers and prosecutor. I don't like being confused in a story hence the 4 star rating.Rebecka has to deal with a young and upcoming prosecutor who wants to push her off the case. But Rebecka takes it all into her own hands but what price does she pay?With this murder happening, Rebecka takes a look back at the family's past and notices more &#34;accidents&#34; have happened.Along with this book taking place in the present we are also taken back into the 1900's where all this pretty much started. I liked the going back and forth between the past and present but at times I felt it was abrupt. As I would get into reading what the dogs found and Marcus the little boy who acts like a wild dog and then bam! In your face you in the past with the school teacher Elina Pettersson. Which when you read her past you get a bit sad. I know there was one part with Elina that I read and I felt so bad for what happened to her.If you like mysteries then I would give this book a read. I think I will be reading more from this author in the future.","06 17, 2014",AL6XJLM76V2VZ,"Autumn Nauling ""Fallen Over Book Reviews""",Pretty interesting read.,1402963200

This is one of my books of the year.An incredibly well written book that draws you in to Jonah's story of being a Master.  He is dominant, confident and articulate without being arrogant.  He is thoughtful but speaks his mind and has an understanding of women that just screams wow off the page at you.In telling his story in this way, we get to see his very thoughtful insights into how he views his role as a Master.  He is a Master that thrives on deriving pleasure from the women who submit to him.Leticia's character grows in confidence as his story unfolds and she becomes bolder with him in a subtle way.  The way that their relationship grows and develops is not in your face but done with subtle nuances.And wow!! The ending was not what I expected - it was so much better than the very predictable endings that we see in pretty much every other book in this genre.  I like the unpredictability of it and together two very well developed and likeable characters in Jonah and Leticia.  Amazing read!","04 28, 2014",A1P6GB064WSTL4,Lisa,"Wow, just wow!",1398643200

0739403133,Books,"[0, 0]",4,"This is the fourteenth novel in the Albert Campion series and was published in 1952.  The book begins with Meg Elginbrodde and Geoffrey Levett in a taxi.  Levett is a wealthy businessman, used to getting what he wants and he is desperately in love with Meg and intends to marry her.  The problem is that since their engagement was announced, Meg has been receiving photographs from her husband - who she believed had died in the war.  She has turned to Campion and Detective Chief Inspector Charles Luke for advice, when a meeting is proposed between her and her former husband. The man she glimpses across the fog bound platform of a station is certainly not her husband, but the mystery deepens after he is questioned and released.What follows is an extremely atmospheric mystery;  set in a post-war, weary London in a middle of a pea souper fog.  As events escalate, Levett goes missing and witnesses are killed.  A convict called Jack Havoc has escaped from prison &#8211; he is hunting a &#8220;treasure&#8221;, while Luke and Campion search for him in the &#8220;Smoke,&#8221; which is the fog bound city of London.  There are some wonderful characters, such as the saintly Canon Avril, the brilliantly named Tiddy Doll and the elusive Havoc himself &#8211; the Tiger of the story.I had only read one Campion novel before and I found myself a little lost so far into the series, as obviously you were meant to know some familiar characters.  However, Campion himself did not feature strongly in the book, meaning that it worked quite well as a stand-alone story.  London itself &#8211; battered, weary, down at heel &#8211; is almost a character in itself.  Everyone stumbles around, unable to see and events are revealed slowly, almost as glimpses through the fog.  If you are interested in London shortly after the war, then this novel gives you a great view of the City at that time and is worth reading just for the historical aspect of the book.","05 11, 2014",A2T7JK9FLC8V0N,"S Riaz ""S Riaz""",The Tiger in the Smoke,1399766400

I could not wait to read Grant's story.  His appearances in the other two books had me wanting to read about THE man....the owner of the club.  Owners of a BDSM club is always my favorite Doms.  Once again, this book actually had an interesting storyline that went with the book well and not page after page of BDSM sex.  Don't get me wrong, I like erotic books but some books like Fifty Shades was way over the top in sex scenes which became page turners.  It is a very romantic book and when you finally hear all of Grant's story, you are pulled into his sadness because his love, his wife, his mate, was so great.  You also felt sorry for Charli because she loved him so much but would not settle for nothing less than a true relationship.  Now....what I did not like in this book is that the BDSM scenes seemed a little bit more darker than what I am use to.  Usually, it is someone else in the club who is receiving the beatings and the two main characters observe.  Not this book and she gets beaten hard.....not spanked with the hand (but that happens too by someone else because Grant is sharing????)  I do not care for where the Sub gets beaten so hard that she cannot lie on her back because it is so sore.  I guess I am old school and I am not into being shared.  If I am a Sub, I sub for only one person and that would go on the List.  Of course, in this book, that is somehow forgotten.  I also do not care for two guys on one girl at the same time and it seems to happen in the &#34;A Loving on the Edge Novels.&#34;  I am just not into that and I cannot see a person who is new at this sort of life would like it either.  My feathers get sort of ruffled when the beatings over something so minor occurs.  This feminist does not care for that, and I cringe when the scene is played out.  Of course, the writer happens to write that the Sub is a feminist but somehow she puts her feelings aside when being dealt with when she has done something wrong, which to me, is such a small thing.  I have no problems with bondage, the scenes, the displaying of the Sub in a scene for all to see, but it is really hard to get past the beatings.  That is something too dark for me.  I prefer Doms who are not into that sort of thing as well.  But all in all, I did give this book five stars because I love how Mrs. Loren writes, and I did not want to give it four stars simply because I shy away from beatings and it seems that others like it.  She makes her Doms very appealing and one cannot help but like her Subs.  As I stated earlier, I love owners of BDSM clubs.  They are the most interesting and the erotic scenes are fantastic.  Do I recommend this book, you bet.  Just be prepared for the more darker side of BDSM.","05 30, 2014",A3JBKFAFTIICJF,"Lady Hecate ""Lady Hecate""",There is not much to not like in this book,1401408000

But when Ashling and her mother get there they learn that he intends to marry her off, even though she is only 14.  Ashling and her mother protest, but it is Ashling's brother who persuades their father to let Ashling wait a few more years before she is to be married to her intended.  A few years pass and Ashling and her mother are found by their pack's enemy.  They run back to her father for protection and it's decided that Ashling should go into hiding with Baran, a sort of lone wolf.  While living with him she meets Grey.  He's not a werewolf but there is something about him that she can't put her finger on, plus she is very interested in him.  Grey reciprocates the attraction, but many obstacles stand in the way of their happy ever after.This story started out great and kept me interested.  It's definitely unique compared to other werewolf stories I've read.  I was a little turned off that Ashling was only 14 at first; I thought I was going to have to read about a 14 year old, but then in the next chapter, a few years pass, so that was good news for me.Ashling is a headstrong female.  She doesn't let anyone, including her father tie her down.  Basically, she does what she wants.  She had great character traits, but I still had a little trouble feeling connected to her.Let's talk about chemistry between Ashling and Grey.  I could tell the attraction was immediate; but for the rest of their relationship I just felt like something was missing.  I can't put my finger on it though.  I honestly didn't care if they were together or not.  I didn't feel the love as much as they were saying it to each other.The story kept me very interested in the beginning, then I did get a little bored towards the middle, but the ending picked up again and I really couldn't put it down.  All in all, Bloodmark was a good book.  And the bonus is that it's the first book of a series.

So it's not the greatest fiction (the plot is fairy tale simple, the characters are over simplified), not the greatest IT Ops case study (while the technical language is perfectly real, the idea of, let's say, offloading &#34;brute force&#34; processing to an external cloud provider or reducing the release cycle within days or fighting off the auditors - all those examples look turning the company around seem hard to believe) and not the greatest book on TCO (for example the book doesn't tell about TCO limitations and side effects stressing out only the positives).However, having said all of that, the book creates an instantly recognized mix of a typical IT Ops management problems and it touches the nerve of hundreds of thousands people in IT Ops or working closely with IT Ops, so it gotta become a big hit.

0975949039,Books,"[1, 1]",5,"I have many good things to say about the book, &#8220;12 Titanic Lessons for Christians&#8221; written by Charles C. Hagan, Jr. I&#8217;m a fan of the 1997 movie about the ill-fated ship and I&#8217;ve seen the movie many times. Because of that, I was immediately drawn to the book&#8217;s title. After I finished reading Hagan&#8217;s book, I can easily say that the author delivers on his promise to motivate, challenge, and empower his readers. He made an excellent choice for a topic. The book&#8217;s cover art alone is intriguing. Even though I&#8217;ve read some other books about the Titanic, I learned some new information here that I didn&#8217;t know. The author has obviously done his homework.I LOVED the poem from Dr. Benjamin Mayes that is on the back cover. I&#8217;d never read that before. There&#8217;s an important lesson in those rhymes that all of us can benefit from. I think it was very appropriate to feature it in this book.The author poses many thought-provoking questions. For instance, if you were among the over fifteen-hundred passengers on that ocean liner and you knew the end of your life was at hand, would you have lived your life differently?  Whoa, reality check! Our lives can be over in the blink of an eye. We get so tied up and self-absorbed at times that we can miss some of the warning signs of danger ahead. Sometimes it takes a Titanic-sized event in our own lives for us to pay attention to what&#8217;s really going on around us.  Perfect peace can only be found through God alone and His gift is there for all of us.  That some choose to reject or ignore the gift is one of the consequences of sin in a fallen world.The writing is good and the book is easy to read. I liked the format a lot &#8211; references at the bottom, fascinating trivia, historical facts, effective use of bold type, historical drawings and photos.  Most importantly, the scriptures the author chose to accompany his work are right on point in my opinion. The lesson titles are aptly named and I appreciated his modern-day parallels. There were a few minor grammar issues, but I didn&#8217;t see anything huge. There was also one confusing sentence for me with some awkward wording. Other than that, I was engaged and eager to read the whole book.There are so many takeaways. One of my favorite lines: &#8220;That we need to be grateful for every moment that we spend on earth.&#8221; Amen to that! I think this book would appeal to a vast audience, Christians and also Non-Christians looking for perspective on the trials of life.","06 2, 2014",AF03MRRM6C5QC,Jreviewit,Well Done,1401667200

Instead of the usual ultra-brave heroine and hero fighting against the evil Nazis in any way they can; we have Beth, a Quaker pacifist, and Josef, a doctor in the German army who happens to believe in the Germany he remembers from childhood.After reading several WWII fiction books that mostly center in the U.S., England, or France, it was nice to read a slightly different view of things in Germany and of the many German's that fought against Hitler's regime in a myriad of ways.One of the fascinating things about the book is all of the Quaker beliefs and methods that are key to the story and how certain characters act. I knew almost nothing about the Society Of Friends, they are a little-written-about group, and so the fact that this story centers around a Quaker girl and some of her family and friends made this story even more interesting for me.The author does an excellent job of immersing the reader in WWII era Munich. I could see everything so clearly in my mind's eye. I felt like I was walking the streets of the city with Beth and Josef, stepping inside the apartment with Uncle Franz and Aunt Ilse, hiding in the basement from falling bombs with Liesl.The last third of the book did seem a bit hurried to me, causing the historical detail and character emotions to take a little dip.That aside, All God's Children was very enjoyable and I will definitely be looking forward to the release of the next book in this series, Simple Faith.The combination of setting the story in a  little used WWII location, the Quaker pacifism, (old) German patriotism, detail in locations, interesting characters, and just the history, make this a great book for lovers of Historical fiction.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher through The Book Club Network in exchange for my honest review.

She's a pro.  This autobiography is revealing as she shows her ribald side, and addresses her fatal attraction to her famous husband Jack Cassidy and her unlikely but successful  marriage to Marty Engels.When you think Shirley Jones, you think pretty, pleasant, warm, calm, talented.  She wants to add another dimension to that image, and makes some odd choices in what she writes about, the most talked-about being her obsession with sex, and that mars the book.

No hesitation. I love that True was more than it seems from the description, that it wasn't simply the story of the bad boy and the virgin. It wasn't a sexual awakening or frivolous at all. True is a love story, pure and simple, of a two people who are near opposites, but fit together so very perfectly.Tyler and Rory were not one-dimensional characters, defined by the sexuality or social standing. They both held many layers, and that complexity really bonded me to both. Tyler grew up in such turmoil, and works so hard to keep his brothers together. He wants more out of life, but doesn't know that he'll ever get it. Tyler has a tough exterior, but is vulnerable with Rory. He's cocky, yet not really conceited. He was brave, yet scared to give his heart to a woman whom he deems too good for him. I loved that he loved Rory exactly as she was.Though I couldn't find any of myself in Rory, I connected with her deeply. I would say that is testament to McCarthy's ability to bring these characters off the page, make me love them. Rory was...she was just Rory. Logical to a fault, quiet and unassuming, always withholding herself and her emotions. I loved who Rory became with Tyler. That she wasn't afraid to push him, question him, and love him. Once Rory decided to open up to Tyler, it was like she became a better version of herself. She was still way literal, but she also joked more. Hugged more, allowed people to truly know her.Oh gosh, I sound like a sap. And I am one when it comes to books such as this. I think what I love about this series is that it is just so real. The characters don't come packaged with the right words or decisions, they mess up and they grovel and they learn and grow. That sort of experience is what I love so much about reading.There was a moment in True that struck me hard, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. It's when Tyler and Rory are discussing Streetcar Named Desire, and Rory just can't understand why these characters are behaving so illogically...&#34;If they would just communicate with each other, they could resolve all their issues in ten minutes.&#34;&#34;That's what makes the book so realistic,&#34; he told me dryly. &#34;Real people don't discuss this shit with each other.&#34;He had a point. I didn't really discuss my emotions with anyone either. I had spent most of my life being a silent observer. &#34;Oh.&#34;In one fell swoop, I got it. Literature wasn't intended to be about perfect people, it was about flaws, very real and very deep human flaws.That is an excellent reminder, I think.If you're looking for a deep, intense, sexy and fun New Adult series, True Believers is, without a doubt, one of my favorites.","06 30, 2014",A19UT0OPQCDR8,Andrea Thompson,I'm a Believer,1404086400

While she knows there has been destruction of personal items or the items have been stolen, Charlotte has promised her father she will again try to raise the rice crop and live on the land.The paragraph above states the setting of the fictional tale that is actually based on a real historical figure named Elizabeth Waties Allston Pringle.  Can you imagine what this woman witnessed in her lifetime?  How about thinking of what her life was like before and after the Civil War?  Charlotte is based loosely on the real life experiences of Elizabeth, and the author, with some minor adaptations, places her novel near where the real plantation where Elizabeth lived.  After you read the fictional tale, the author shares how she came to learn about this unique woman and her life.There are characters that portray what southern people must have felt during Reconstruction along with what many veterans suffered during a horrific war.  They had to learn to live in a new society that was still forming.  With so few eligible men to marry, we see a jealous female antagonist see that she indeed ends up with the one man she sets her eyes on no matter who gets hurt in reaching her goal.  Yellow fever is an epidemic that costs many lives in New Orleans in 1868.  With the destruction so complete, few can prove they own the land on which they return to.Dorothy Love writes a moving masterpiece that keeps the reader reading until they see how the unknown ending is revealed.  I simply cannot express how much the real woman Elizabeth, along with others who lived in the south before, during and after the war, had to learn how to start all over.  Readers see how a woman who has her faith shredded by heartbreak learns to trust God again in a time when each day brings new trials, triumphs or tragedy.  What a tenacity people displayed to endure and then to thrive each day.  Perhaps like our female lead character they did so by looking to God and putting one foot in front of the other time and time again.  A historical novel rich with history, faith, perseverance and romance!  Don&#8217;t pass up reading this book!","01 10, 2014",A2IEEN02KO9ISO,lighthouse88,Carolina Gold,1389312000

When Frances died, she promised to communicate, telepathically, from the other side of the &#34;veil.&#34; In Helen's book, she describes a message from Frances that death is not to be feared, for it is not the end. &#34;Death of the body is but a gentle passing to a much freer life.&#34; Our soul is then gently, &#34;cleansed, healed and released,&#34; as we continue through various stages of transition toward &#34;The Light.&#34;  She explains that our earthly bodies and personality continue to transform thru many levels or planes of light, which she describes as having different vibrational frequencies, until we are eventually one with &#34;The Light.&#34; She then goes on to use this reasoning for such statements as Christ's words, 'I am the Light of the World,&#34; for he projects pure light and as people transform, they &#34;Let their light shine.&#34;These words are very comforting for people who continue to ask if there is an afterlife. However, her description of the afterlife broken up into various groups who are set to perform various jobs, etc are a bit difficult to conceptualize.  Certainly, this view of the afterlife differs from what we are taught and led to believe in various churches or religions. Testimony of Light is an interesting concept of the afterlife and touches on the possibility of reincarnation and the reasons why some may have that experience.The book and the message it puts forth will certainly test your faith and ideas of the afterlife. Some parts of her theory are difficult to understand.

0316204366,Books,"[0, 0]",3,"In &#34;David and Goliath,&#34; best-selling author and pop sociologist Malcolm Gladwell examines why underdogs routinely triumph over authority.  His answer is that we often misinterpret underdogs, and that because of their experience and circumstances underdogs tend to be tenacious, play by their own rules, and are cunning.  Then there's the problem of authority, which in its often expression and extension of its strength over-estimates the enemy and degrades its own authority.For loyal readers of Malcolm Gladwell, and I certainly count myself as one of them, &#34;David and Goliath&#34; is a sure letdown from Gladwell at his peak (&#34;Outliers&#34;).  The beauty and facility of his prose are still there, but his thinking -- never his strength -- has become muddied and muddled.  He has a habit of making points that are entirely obvious, and sometimes even making points that have no basis in reality.  For example, in one chapter on academic achievement, Gladwell assumes that every student at Harvard wants to study STEM, and if they switch from STEM to arts it's become they couldn't hack it.  And what is his advice to make sure that America produces enough STEM talent?  Encourage top-performing high school students to apply to less prestigious institutions, where they will become a big fish in a small pond and not become lost and insecure as a small fish in a big pond.That argument is intuitive, but Gladwell has a bad habit of trying to wrap his intuitive arguments under the cloak of scientific rigor, and so what often happens is that when you pull the cloak away there's really nothing there at all.","01 22, 2014",A2XQMGE2YY88DC,Jiang Xueqin,"The Advantages of Disadvantages, and the Disadvantages of Advantages",1390348800

It's in a genre I don't normally choose, but good writing will suck me in every time and I thought Dana Reinhardt did a fabulous job giving life and voice to the Golden sisters.We didn't need anybody else.  But more than that,we were better  without anybody else.The story is about Nell and Layla, their family and friends. They are sisters who are very, very close. Layla's the older sister. She's one of those girls whose life seems charmed. She's smart, talented, loving and athletic. A sensible teen who has her act together. Nell is her little sister. Nell appears to be every bit as gifted and smart as her sister, but she's at an age and a place in her life where she can't see that yet. And for the time being she's in Layla's shadow. But she's okay with that. She loves Layla fiercely.I'll probably always remember where I was andwhat I wore and all that, it was that kind of moment.I could no longer pretend.Something was happening.Something that shouldn't be.And I had absolutely no idea what to do.WE ARE THE GOLDENS is about love and betrayal and the basic human condition. Our inability, on the one hand, to see our own doom racing towards us. And our total freaking cluelessness as to what to do when we see disaster poised to strike someone we love.~This book worked for me on so many levels. The writing was excellent. Nell's voice was a perfect blend of intelligence and innocence. It made her dilemmas believable. I also loved Nell's relationship with Felix, her BFF. Adorable isn't strong enough a word.What I don't understand was Dana Reinhardt's having Nell converse with the dead boys. They were probably there to underscore some subtle point, but I wasn't smart enough to figure it out.I don't have a lot of books in my repertoire to compare this to.  But if you enjoyed  Swati Avasthi's SPLIT, or  Francisco Stork's LAST SUMMER OF THE DEATH WARRIORS, or even Green's FAULT IN OUR STARS, you might want to pick this up.I think the 'undetermined' ending is going to throw some readers. (Lady or the Tiger?)  But I also think it's part and parcel of what is going to make WE ARE THE GOLDENS a fabulous book club read.

To me, it's shocking that almost no mainstream doctors and so few ""experts"", much less writers of books like this, are aware that fibromyalgia is a symptom of low thyroid (hypothyroid). Shocking.There are no lab tests for many causes of low thyroid, so at least 80% of us are mis-diagnosed, because your doctor will only treat lab tests, not you. The FREE basal (at rest) temperature self-test is THE gold standard for low thyroid problems and - with your symptoms - means more than any lab test (although most conventional doctors, including endos, won't agree but then they're not trained to understand thyroid problems - go to the Broda Barnes foundation website and click on the ""Educational Info"" button on the left for how to get a list of thyroid-sympathetic doctors in your state.(I'd always suspected a thyroid problem but it was not until, after 20 years of being told all my lab tests were ""normal"", that a Broda Barnes trained doctor finally put me on the road to recovery. A year after I insisted my cousin also see this doctor, she said I'd saved her life.)The basal temperature home self-test will pick up conditions that current lab tests don't, such as thyroid resistance. Most digital thermometers are not accurate so find a good basal digital thermometer, the kind used by women to identify their fertile days.The stopthethyroidmadness website has excellent instructions for this self-test, as well as several for adrenal fatigue, which often goes hand-in-hand with low thyroid. The two most common health problems worldwide, they're rarely diagnosed or treated.I also suggest:- ""The Metabolic Treatment of Fibromyalgia"" by Lowe, a very expensive medical book of more than 1,000 pages, essentially explaining how fibromyalgia is successfully treated with thyroid supplements;- `Hypothyroidism Type 2' by Mark Starr (""type 2"" meaning the thyroid problems for which there are no lab tests and therefore they don't get diagnosed) explains how all chronic pain is linked to low thyroid, including those involved with fibromyalgia, diabetes, heart problems, both bleeding & blood clots (including strokes) and some cancers. If you have any kind of chronic pain, you need to know that some are calling low thyroid the silent epidemic (silent because officially denied);- ""Hypothyroidism, Health & Happiness: The Riddle of Illness Revealed"" by Steven F. Hotze a good introduction;- As there is rarely more than a brief mention of the benefits of iodine in thyroid books, I also suggest ""Iodine, Why You Need It and Why You Can't Live Without It"" by David Brownstein MD. The latest edition is available as an ebook from drbrownstein[dot]directfrompublisher[dot]comAlso, those with fibromyalgia experience a significant reduction in their symptoms when taking a melatonin supplement and melatonin can reduce some symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain. Melatonin increases the conversion of precursor thyroid hormone T4 to the active T3 form. It can reactivate the important but much-ignored thymus gland, which degenerates almost completely over the years. It also improves zinc absorption, which in turn boosts several immune functions. Melatonin therapy also helps spleen recovery, another immune-system component which declines with age. Its ability to improve sleep and dreaming is a tremendous boon to memory. It is one of the most powerful antioxidants made by the body.","06 18, 2014",A1JXV4SWMTR3XF,D&D,"nothing works long-term, until you address the real cause",1403049600

Lawyers and judges need to be emotionally unattached to their cases, and this book definitely reads like it was written by a lawyer. I find myself asking &#34;how did she feel?&#34; during many of the pages. She talks nothing about her feelings for her boyfriend/husband. Was he her first love? He would visit her every weekend during college -- how did she feel about the long-distance relationship? Did she have any doubts? As for her accomplishments, I still find myself wondering how she felt about herself.

You're framed for a fire that injures your friend, and further attempts are made on your life. The killer? It's you! Copied, by S.M. Anderson, from Curiosity Quills Press is a first-rate thriller with science fiction overtones that explores several ethical questions including the issue of genetic engineering, human cloning, and the prospect that a corporation can ""own"" a clone because they own the DNA of that person.More importantly, Copied also examines the theory of nature vs. nurture regarding two identical clones. The protagonists of the story -- very likable ones -- Alexander Mitchell (""Xan"") and his friend Lacey (a remarkably bright, teen girl) are determined to figure out just who and why someone would want Xan dead.I don't give spoilers, and there are plenty of clever plot twists and action that keep the story moving at a fast pace.

He&#8217;s an only child, however, and his foreman is always harping that Walker needs an heir. He&#8217;s young and healthy, though, so he&#8217;s in no hurry, until a bull almost kills him. Since he can&#8217;t bring himself to court again, he makes arrangements for a mail order bride.Sarah Livingston&#8217;s father just doesn&#8217;t understand how much she wants a husband and children of her own, and he doesn&#8217;t think anyone is good enough, unless it&#8217;s a man who doesn&#8217;t want to marry her. When her father decides to send her to Uncle Brice&#8217;s in Georgia after her last escapade, she knows she&#8217;ll have to do something desperate. She decides to run to her friend in New York, but, on the way, she meets a young woman crying because she has to become a mail order bride. Sarah switches places with her, and when she meets Walker, she knows she did the right thing. Can she put off telling him the truth long enough to make him fall in love with her? As she tries, things become more and more complicated and messy.For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sarah is stubborn but lovable, because she has a big heart and wants to do the right thing, even when she makes bad choices. Walker is just as stubborn in his own way, and I could understand why he was leery of being deceived. Some of the things that happened with Caleb wasn&#8217;t rational, and I was surprised Sarah ran away when she had promised Walker she wouldn&#8217;t. The cover of the book is also wrong, because Sarah was a redhead. Overall, however, the story was riveting and a page-turner, and I had no problems giving it five stars.","03 4, 2014",AAIDLB38IY7R6,J. Hopkins,I Found It a Page-turner,1393891200

I've begun to notice a pattern, however, which doesn't always work. Towards the end of the story, the guy has some sort of crisis, breaks off the blossoming romance in a particularly hurtful way; she gets surrounded by her friends usually bearing margaritas; and then he comes back with his tail between his legs and humbly asks her back in a way that will be public or involve multiple other people. She immediately jumps into his arms and the book ends.  Its a formula that is started to make me roll my eyes, especially in this story due to the fact that Jack is extremely cruel to those around him there at the end. His redemption within the eyes of his friends and Larissa happens so fast, one starts to think the author ran up against a page length issue. In Fool's Gold, men get to be jerks - publically -  and women love them unconditionally. Redemption and forgiveness happens to two pages or less.And so these stories become fairy tales as opposed to a warm window into the heart of how complicated love and relationships are. I'd love to see Mallery give as much time to the character development that happens when people have been pulled apart and hurt by love as she does to why they are so afraid of it in the first place.","07 11, 2014",ATF0AXQRMC2CF,"J.

And somehow she always manages to be wearing the wrong underwear every time it happens&#8230;Wearing a red lace thong while getting arrested isn't really the best option. She meets and falls for a sexy Australian named Wayne but she doesn't feel like he's the boy she should love. But over the course of the 14 years they somehow keep winding up finding each other again, even while she fights it all the way. Lola doesn't really know what she wants for the future or how to get it, but along the way she finds that maybe the wrong guy could end up being the right one after all.The name alone should have you intrigued. It did me. It's a cute and funny title to go with a cute and funny book. It hooks you and you can't wait to see how it all ends up. It wasn't really what I expected. I don't think the description does this book justice. I was expecting a light hearted romantic comedy and got so much more. While the book is cute and funny it is also real and has some serious moments.Lola is a great character. She is witty and funny and she makes these hilarious random lists. She is real and flawed beyond belief but you can't help but laugh and cry and prey that she can get it together. And maybe even find her happy ending.There is a bunch of humorous surrounding characters that make you laugh and really feel for all Lola has to put up with. With a bossy, slightly self obsessed; over involved mom and a sister very similar to their mom it makes for a laugh fest. And that is just the beginning of her crazy family and friends.  Wayne is a total boy crush and I kept begging for him to finally get the girl. He is rugged and sexy and oo la la. I wish there had been more of him in the story though, he was that good.It jumps around a bit throughout the 14 years to explain everything, but it's worth it. I was hooked quickly and couldn't put it down. I recommend this book completely.","03 3, 2014",AEJ7GU73LSMF0,Danielle Eisner,I was expecting a light hearted romantic comedy and got so much more.,1393804800

The book used a lot of comparisons to really get the point across and a little bit of history was brought in the mix so you could really see where it all started.  As with most theories and information on stocks and trading, the dow theory is heavily concentrated on recognizing, analyzing, and being aware of trends.

She has a positive attitude knowing she&#8217;ll find a solution to her problems especially since worry has never rolled up its sleeves and solved anything. And now, by a fortuitous happenstance she can continue making a difference and spreading cheer after being saved from an encounter with certain death by a stranger.Liam &#8220;Kally&#8221; Kallen has been scarred by his wife&#8217;s death. Not only has his career suffered from it, he is also plagued with a guilt he can hardly talk about much less expunge, tinting his life a dull gray. That is until his concern leads him to save Noelle and his protectiveness guides him to incorporate her into his life. She gives him a new optimistic view and a second chance at love he thought he would never get again.The only problem is Liam and Noelle have too much to give. Liam in the way of material needs and Noelle in terms of positive emotions. Their relationship was too new, moving too fast it&#8217;s overwhelming, forcing Noelle to walk away unless they can find a way to balance their bond.I ached for Liam and his broken soul. Liam made me sympathized with him and his tragic loss. I felt terrible for his misplaced guilt, I understood his confusion over the new opportunity life gave him at a perfect love. He&#8217;s a different kind of take charge heroI enjoyed reading about.I was completely charmed with Noelle&#8217;s character and her desire to do something meaningful with her life. I honestly wish I had that strength of character. But there were also times when my very practical side wanted to slap her and Liam silly for not talking, exploring options and trying to find some kind of middle ground.It&#8217;s really great reading about the previous couples and characters in the team. Their family like bond and their support in this particular book shone through.I was so glad I got to read more about Jamie Babcock, having him living with Kally. He&#8217;s still young enough to be completely cute and adorable but also old enough to be an alpha male with his very own Babs signature.Liam and Noelle&#8217;s story blew me away with the amount of emotions it stirred. A couple of times bringing me to tears. It moved me and left me wanting to make a difference myself.This is the third book in the Portland Storm series. You could probably read it without reading the previous books but you would be missing out on the characters that appear as secondary in this book. I strongly suggest you read the series in order.And for those of you who are Tammy Falkner fans and follow her Reed Brothers series, can you guess where Liam gets his tattoos at?","06 16, 2014",A3JVF17MIYLTOO,Dalitza,"Sweet, sexy and inspiring",1402876800

This of course just depends on the author.  There is sex and there is an okay amount of detail about the sex but I have read romances where the sex could span two or three pages and quite frankly I can only read so much of how the hero takes his velvet steel into her moist folds before I just decide to skip ahead.Now that I'm clear about the fact that there is sex here I'll also tell you that for most of this book I was wondering how the heck was this going to resolve!  I too was feeling torn!The book does require some editing I'll have to admit but it's really not something that should impact your enjoyment of the book.

Marie F Crow does something that many other authors don&#8217;t, she grabs your attention and tells you a story that is beyond the scope of your traditional zombie narrative. Sure there are components that you will find with others, but what really throws you for a loop here is the main character and the scope of the larger picture.Much like &#8220;Walking Dead&#8221; features a great deal of emotion, Helena (the main character) is a catalyst for so many points of fear, regret, life, and so much more. Crow finds a way of establishing this character, deeply rooted in emotion, so when she goes through the story, you&#8217;re floored with excitement.It&#8217;s hard not to shed a tear at some points, as some of the family bonding, even within the scope of a motorcycle club begins to pull at your heartstrings. Mixing &#8220;Sons of Anarchy&#8221; with &#8220;The Walking Dead&#8221; is about as close as I can come to trying to tell you what this narrative is like. It&#8217;s multi-layered, has zombies, but grips your heart with a certain horror that is missing from a lot of other zombie tales. I found it intrepid, compelling, and worth a second read, just not in the dark. My cat scared me while reading. There&#8217;s a lot of good found in this one.

0316955116,Books,"[1, 1]",4,"In the spring of 1956, when I was 12 1/2 years old, living in Queens, and finishing the 7th grade (just like Herbie), my parents bought Herman Wouk's ""Marjorie Morningstar,"" and I started reading it.  I found it a bit ponderous, at least for my 12-year-old taste, and my parents thought it might be too ""mature"" for a little kid.  So my mother went to our local library and borrowed ""City Boy,"" telling me I'd love it.She was absolutely right, although I took umbrage at identifying myself as a ""Herbie.""  Unlike the book's protagonist, I was big and strong for my age and a decent athlete who could hit a baseball a mile (catching it was a different story) and who could take care of himself, so I tried to think of myself as a ""Lennie"" (the big, dumb kid who was Herbie's rival) although I found his character a bit repulsive, as he was a bully and I (generally) wasn't. I paid little attention to the subplot involving Lucille Glass (I wasn't yet interested in girls), and even less to that involving the attempted buyout of ""The Place,"" the ice factory co-owned by Herbie and Lennie's fathers, and by a silent partner, Mr. Powers.  The following year, I went to a sleepaway camp much like Camp Manitou, and with my bunkmates at Bunk 9, put a few of Herbie's ideas into play.  By that time my interest in the opposite sex started to manifest itself.  Did it ever.Recently I bought ""City Boy"" along with ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""Marjorie Morningstar"" (which my wife is reading for the second time), and I've come to the conclusion that despite the fact that I could hit a spaldeen 3 sewers as a kid, I was very much a Herbie, then and now, who would soon develop his hopeless crush on his very own Lucille Glass -- actually two of them--sequentially and many years separated, both of whom I met at yet another summer camp.  (One of the two even grew up in the Bronx, not all that far in distance from Mosholu Parkway where Lucille lived but light-years away demographically and culturally.)Like Herbie, I was that lad who would ride in the front car of the subway with his buddies, noses pressed up against the glass by the motorman's cab as we watched the train fly through the tunnel as we headed towards Ebbets Field in Brooklyn where we would emerge into dazzling sunlight at the Prospect Park station to watch the immortal Duke blast frozen ropes onto Bedford Avenue before the great No. 4 and the other Dodgers would desert us for the purported Sybaritic paradise of La-la Land.  The crushes would come a couple years later, and last forever.  I suspect Herbie, now 97, still has a thing for 96-year-old Lucille.Let's briefly summarize the plot:  1928. Herbie Bookbinder, a precocious and manipulative 11-year-old a year ahead of his class in school, develops a crush on a little girl, Lucille Glass, a grade behind him.  Lucille tells Herbie she's going to attend Camp Manitou, a kid's summer camp in the Berkshires run by Mr. Gauss, the school's principal.  Herbie wheedles his parents into letting him go there.  Also attending will be Lennie Krieger, a lunkheaded 13-year-old who's a year behind his class, and about to be left back again. Herbie's father and Lennie's father are co-owners of an ice-making business called ""The Place,, and there's an Irish silent partner named Powers who may or may not own a controlling interest in the business, and who wants to sell it to a third party so he can cover some bad outside investments.  Lucille's father is an attorney who represents the business, but seems to represent Powers more than the other two partners.Herbie gets to camp, and quickly learns it's no paradise; ""Uncle"" Gauss is far more interested in turning a profit by cutting corners than in molding childrens' characters.  Moreover, Herbie's a lousy athlete, and is taunted by the older boys, with the bullying led by Lennie.  Herbie, in an effort to impress Lucille, wants to build an amusement park-type ride for the camp's Mardi Gras Day, but the materials to build it will cost $50 (equivalent to $1,000 today) which he doesn't have.  How to get the money?  Steal it from his dad's safe (Herbie knows the combination); then leave a promissory note guaranteeing repayment.  In an mad series of adventures, Herbie and his cousin Cliff sneak out of camp, hitchhike the 100 miles back to the Bronx in the middle of the night, only to find Mr. Bookbinder and his partners engaged in an acrimonious discussion about selling off the company.  When the men are somehow distracted, Herbie and Cliff steal $50 from the thousands in the safe, hightail it out of there, and hitch back to Camp Manitou before reveille the next morning, without anyone noticing.  Herbie, assisted by Cliff, a broken-down horse, and the camp's handyman, who turns out to be Herbie's mentor, builds his ride. It's a big success, making far more than the $50 cost of materials, and most important, Herbie finally impresses the ""fickle"" Lucille.  But Herbie's troubles are only beginning, and the conclusion of the story brings the three legs of the plot together.One thing I really liked was that Herbie and his pals navigated the NYC subway system by themselves at age 11, just as I did back in the '50's.  NYC, including the subways, has become as safe as it was 55 years ago, but most parents think it's still 1990 and riding the subway is as dangerous as being in Afghanistan.  Today, if an 11-year-old is seen riding the subway, Child Protective Services will accuse his parents of neglect.  Another thing that I totally agreed with was that Wouk, without explicitly saying so, is opposed to smart kids skipping grades.  Herbie was 1 1/2 years ahead intellectually, but socially and physically he was still only 11, which is especially troublesome for boys.  Fortunately, the NYC school system has largely abandoned this.In conclusion, I found the story far more entertaining as an adult than I did as a child, and I loved it back then.  Yet I can't give it 5 stars, as much as I'd like to, because Wouk is overly on-the-nose in drumming the story's moral - the ends don't justify the means - into the innocent and not-so-innocent readers.  In the Caine Mutiny, where there are more than 50 shades of grey to describe the characters of the ensemble cast (including Lt. Commander Queeq), Wouk lets their actions do the moralizing, rather than editorialize. That said, I whole-heartedly recommend this for children of all ages, and would grade this 4 1/2 stars if I could.","03 5, 2014",A3CPQHC1I7CGVD,Dan Silagi,"I Read Two Different Books; Once at Age 12, the Second More than 50 Years Later",1393977600

If you are looking for a romance novel, then this book is hot what I would call romantic, The romantic involvement for Schyler is a Cajun who lives on the bayou, Cash Boudreaux.  He is as foul mouthed and crude as they come.  How any woman could find anything romantic about this man is beyound me.There are a number of other sex scenes with other characters that I basically skipped over.  I am not a blushing virgin and I have read many romance novels in the past but this one is so crass that I was even appalled.Also for dog lovers, this book has a pit bull fight that I could not read.  Cruelty to animals and to people is another reason that I did not like this book.  Also stereotypes abound about the south in this book that are so overdone as to be silly.&#34;Slow Heat in Heaven&#34; is one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels; I will stick to reading her more current books because they have more appeal to me.  This one barely earns that two stars that I am giving it.","01 12, 2014",A246RNOSR76X3T,"JerseyGirl ""Bookworm""",Pass on this one!,1389484800

Oh yeah it also has plenty of crazy, funny moments by the Parker sisters.Cambree is off at college and has agreed to meet up with Max but other things take place which leads to Cambree being attacked. Cambree knows who is responsible for the attack on her, the pycho who has been torturing the Parker family for years, Brent. Even though Cambree is strong, this attack has pushed her to the one man that broke her heart, Max Baird. Her love for him never changed, but she just couldn't deal with all secrets and lies Max fed her. Cambree will not give in to easily to Max, he must prove himself.Max feels guilty about Cambree's attack, he was supposed to be protecting her, but in turn brought her into harms way. Max knows he screwed up in the past, and is determined to make it up to Cambree. He wants to start their relationship right this time with no lies and no secrets. Until everything can be revealed he has to hold back expressing the way he truly feels about Cambree, but is still going to be by her side no matter what. He will protect her this time, no more slip ups.As Max and Mitch work on a case against Brent, more secrets are revealed that may help them catching Brent and putting him away for good. Mitch has his own secret that he needs to tell the family but isn't for sure how or when he should tell them. Max and Mitch have to make tough decisions about what to tell the Parker family, because just they know any deviation in their plans could risk everything they have built up in the case so far.Even though there is so much drama going on with the Parker gang, they all no how to act crazy and have fun when the moment is right. The women in the family are strong-willed and sassy, while their men support them and know when to back down. I seriously love the things that come out the Parker sister's mouths, it is hilarious. I love the multiple POVs from all the family during the book. After following the Parker gang since the beginning of the series I feel like I'm apart of the family. I loved how Cambree and Max's story ended. I can't wait to read Dustin's story.","05 5, 2014",A3UYID16MQU45M,Chicks Looking For A Book Fix,Awesome Series!!,1399248000
1476751447,Books,"[31, 52]",1,"We all remember that Hillary lost to Obama in 2008. In 'Hard Choices' she tells us that she then planned to return to the Senate and was surprised when Obama offered the Secretary of State position to her. Supposedly she liked the idea of following one of her heroes, William Seward - another N.Y. senator who lost out to the ultimate president (Lincoln), and then served in his cabinet. (Who ever heard of William Seward? And why the focus on 'political heroes' instead of the opportunity to better America?) We're supposed to believe that personal political calculation had nothing to do with her acceptance - 'When your President asks you to serve, you should say Yes.'Hillary's narration shows her as consistently hawkish, consistent with her previously insisting on serving on the Armed Services Committee while a senator, and voting for the Iraq War. But I also saw her as constantly sticking her nose into every other nation's affairs - to the point she came across as domineering and insulting; not surprisingly, she doesn't see it that way in 'Hard Choices.'As for Benghazi, it's lot of double-talk, taking all positions at the same time, but failing to address the question of 'Why did the U.S. even have a State Dept. office in a non-capital city in Libya?' Putin - he's a bad guy, but she fails to see that his help is essential in addressing problems in Syria and Iran, issues with Russian hackers interfering with U.S. commerce and Internet traffic, and probably Iraq. Thus, her/our demonizing him (and others) simply makes progress in other areas more difficult, if not impossible. Pivoting to Asia - another demonizing tactic that supposedly makes America (and Hillary) look tough, but makes little sense. Today we're seeking help from Iran to stem the Sunni uprising in Iraq. We need China's ongoing help (and that of others) to address Global Warming; on the other hand, we also need to stop letting Asia in general (and China in particular) decimate our economy. Free Trade is working - for them, not us. Regardless, who in America wants to risk losing eg. L.A. and Seattle to defend some miniscule island in the Pacific, thousands of miles away?We also get the cloy ploy for sympathy - 'there's a double standard applied to women in politics.' Tell that to Angela Merkel and others.Overall, 'Hard Choices' is rather boring and overly vague on specifics. Meanwhile, her political spin continues - this week it's a lame explanation of why she charges so much for speaking engagements.If anybody out there doesn't think 'Hard Choices' isn't a planned step on the road to the 2016 nomination, I've got a lot of bridges I'd like to sell you.","06 13, 2014",A22RY8N8CNDF3A,"Loyd E.

When one of the two suspects is quickly found murdered, the Leggetts' story about what really happened begins to unravel. As it does, the past and the present slowly reveal themselves in a quagmire of trouble.For most novels, this would be enough material to fill one book, but for Dashiell Hammett, this is only the first of three parts that become steadily darker and seedier as the story progresses. The key figure in the book is Gabrielle Leggett, the confused, aloof daughter plagued by her own demons. Just when the Continental Op thinks he's done with the family, he's asked to watch over Gabrielle who's recovering from tragedy at a Temple, which appears to be a religious cult. From there, things only get worse.What can I say about Dashiell Hammett that hasn't already been said? Having read his work after so many years, I understand why he's considered one of the masters of the detective novel. It was a welcome change to read mystery that's kicking it old style. There's no hi-tech gimmicks in this story, just a lot of leg work and--on the downside--some sexism and racist slurs that were prevalent back then. Still, this whodunit will keep you guessing as hidden agendas and connections make a simple plot increasingly complex. Having said that, the twisted motivations and secret relationships in this book became so extensive that it stretched credibility by the end, however this won't deter us true Hammett fans from reading more of his work.","03 8, 2014",A3VL7MU8U9DOV0,"Debra Purdy Kong ""Mystery Author""",Complex Story From One of the Best,1394236800

While the romance was as good as I've come to expect from this series, I have to say that I found the advancements in the overall story arc for the series equally compelling.Jessica and Travis were a great couple.  They had me laughing, sighing at the tender moments and groaning over their mutual stubbornness.  Before I go much further, I should point out that this one is very much connected to the ones that came before it.  It assumes the reader is familiar with the history of several people and the ongoing situation that makes them time travelers.Jessica Battaglia is a nurse at a hospital in Harrisburg and her life leaves her content with the exception of painful situation of her grandfather walking away from his marriage and taking up with a much younger woman.  She can't forgive him for this and doesn't trust his new wife, but she agrees to come to dinner along with her best friend, Hailey for moral support.  At the dinner, all goes wrong and she ends up accused of murdering her own grandfather and taken into custody even while her friend is taken to the hospital because Eve drugged them.  While sitting in the interrogation room, something weird happens and she blacks out only to end up in the countryside almost a hundred and fifty years before her time trying to convince a guy that she's not crazy.Travis Wade, a Union deserter and thought dead, is making his way back to his uncle in Harrisburg to get his help when he stumbles on a crazy beautiful woman who thinks she's from the future.  It's not long before he learns that her bizarre story is indeed the truth when he encounters more time travelers just like her and they all know his uncle and his brother.  His life is turned upside down and his attraction to Jessica is at the center of this.  Each time he is near her though he ends up saying or doing the wrong stuff that causes an argument.  He has no idea what to do and recognizes that if he doesn't figure it out quick, she'll leave him behind to return to her own time.Jessica is all stirred up when it comes to Travis and she doesn't know what to think about the irritating man who both makes her go weak at the knees and gives her the urge to hit him all at the same time.  She has the added distraction of worrying what is going on with her grandfather's murder and her friend's precarious survival in her absence.  Her heart is divided and she has no idea what to do.In the meantime, she is enjoying the camaraderie and family of people who have taken her into their life and made her one of their own.  Sophie and Jamie kindly do all they can for her and Travis, Em and Hannah are busy with babies and pregnancies and they're all caught up in the events brought on by the War.  The mysterious Madame and others are at work in the shadows orchestrating things that effect everyone's lives.As I said earlier, the plot on this one was loaded with action and suspense which I loved.  The pace moved along pretty good.  I enjoyed the reveals about the bad guys' plottings.  Jessica and Travis were key figures that the good guys had to protect and the bad guys take out for the opposing people to get their victories.  The murder plot in the contemporary time just made things even more exciting.As to the romance and characters of Jessica and Travis, I really liked it for the most part.  They were both so stubborn and unwilling to see the other's perspective at times that I got frustrated.  And there was a period where denial of feelings caused stupid setbacks for them, but fortunately they had Sophie and Jamie around to knock some sense into their heads.  I suppose all the conflict leading up to the resolve just made the resolve that much sweeter.It was fun to get a peek in with everyone else as they all played a big part in the story including Crow and Shaye in the future.  Looking forward to what comes next.This book and the series it is part of would appeal to those who enjoy sweeter romances in a time-travel situation that is spent mostly in the American Civil War era.My thanks to the author for gifting me a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review thoughts.","01 19, 2014",A3MT311233OHMQ,"Sophia Rose ""Guest Reviewer for Delighted Rea...",Rivals My Favorites in the Series For Romance and Suspense,1390089600

Based on the plot and writing of this one, I would be willing to check out the first book from the library. I can't say I was head over heels in love to want to buy it.Jaycee missed the last text of her best friend Rachel's life, caught up in her first kiss and lingering anger from a fight between the girls six months previously. This haunts her as she starts to believe there was more to Rachel's death than is being shared and confirmed when she receives unlikely aid from a friend of Rachel's, sending her down a path of gangs, hazing initiations, jealousy, and racial tensions in a small insular Washington town.For me, this book's big strength was its fast-paced. I read it all in one frantic day, barely able to put it down as each chapter only impelled me to read further. I credit this to the writing and plotting of Wolf-she really kept me on the edge of my seat.Also of interest was peeling back the layers of racism and mistrust between the old timers of the small town and the migrant workers, some of whom may be there illegally. When Rachel is murdered, it is all too easy to lay the blame at the feet of someone who allegedly has ties to a gang or whose skin is a different color from yours. I'm not sure this was handled as thoroughly as it could have been but it might be enlightening for some people and it helped to ratchet up the tension in the beginning of the book.But its weakness for me was its timid and naive narrator, though as the book progresses the reader gets a sense of her strong moral fortitude. I guess you could compare her to Fanny Price of Mansfield Park. She lives within her father's stringent rules and doesn't try to push the bounds of what it means to be a good girl, accepting her fate as one of the uncool. But her best friend considers her the best person she knows, someone who knows right from wrong and will diligently work to expose the truth and render justice (not vengeance, a key distinction). Saying that, even as I admire those kinds of people, they don't tend to be my favorite book characters. I like a bit more flamboyance and wit a la Elizabeth Bennet. The naivety is especially frustrating when it came to the culprit; I started having my suspicions probably later than others but it was eons before Jaycee with her trusting heart.Overall: I am eager to hear the opinion of people who have read Wolf's previous outing as well as those who are well-versed in YA mystery/thrillers. How do you think this stacks up? Personally I think this is a can-miss. Give it a read if the concept sounds intriguing to you but otherwise, don't feel bad about passing over it.","01 12, 2014",AISUSPFYY68RO,bookworm1858,A review from Bookworm1858,1389484800

It was almost insulting to read the line (paraphrasing here), &#34;I checked to make sure I had weapons...and all that.&#34; Pretty far removed from John Rain. No details on the plan, type of knife, exploring the angles and options for implementing his plan. The fight sequences with the Russians read like a bad movie plot. Trading face punches?

Who do we have in the field that can check on this further?&#8221; Avery asks when an American plane is shot down over the Sea of Japan in the beginning of Steve Wilson&#8217;s novel, &#34;Red Sky at Morning.&#34;This first book in the Michael Neill Adventure series targets readers who like military strategy, nuclear warfare, and political intrigue in current day scenarios. With no profanity or sexual scenes, this Christian-based story includes violence due to the topic of nuclear destruction.In this tome, United States First Lieutenant Michael Neill grew up with his missionary parents in the Ukraine but has not returned to the country for over eight years. As a Marine, he speaks several languages working as a Marine in the Security Forces Squadron.When his military friend&#8217;s plane flies too low near the Russian coastline due to inclement weather and is shot down by a fighter plane with stealth technology, Neill is heart-broken of his friend&#8217;s demise but knows God is in control. Yet on the broad scale, other governments want their own control and power in the former Soviet Union area, especially when it involves nuclear weapons.Ordered by the Unites States, the Marine&#8217;s instructions are to verify the status of thirty-six C-type nuclear warheads that are to be disassembled at the Odessa plant in the Ukraine. Added to his duties, he must uncover information about the sixth-generation stealth fighter that killed his comrade.While Neill meets up with his old Ukrainian friend, Andrei Ulyanov, who now runs the disarmament program at Odessa, the two Christian men pray for wisdom and guidance when they learn one warhead is missing. Realizing it could be a dirty bomb or full-fledge nuke, they, along with a persistent beautiful journalist, try to anticipate where two Russians who want to restore the old Soviet Union have hidden the deadly device.Counting down to detonation, readers become engaged in the military espionage and patriotism for one&#8217;s homeland as pages turn quickly to find out if this time there will be radiological dispersion. As a well-written, technical military tale, Wilson set up a great series where one man&#8217;s faith in God is consistent as he deals with others on a personal or global level.Thanks to CWA Review Crew for furnishing this book in exchange for a review of the reader&#8217;s honest opinion.","01 11, 2014",A1DPU1ZBRWSFD3,connywithay,Having Faith During Ukrainian Nuke Crisis,1389398400

He stands with the most popular authors of this genre as he writes another gripping suspense.  Sacred rituals await a teenaged girl as the villain scopes her out at the mall watching her dance around her boyfriend.  That evening George Madden drops off his wife, Edna, at the weekly prayer meeting.  As usual, he has his own weekly meeting at the prostitute club, ""Silk Stockings.""  After he gets his satisfaction, it's hard for him to see while driving on the dark country road at night.  However, as he glances toward a stand of trees, he notices a person dressed in all white running and stumbling through the trees.  He stops, grabs a flashlight, and works his way through the brambles to find a young girl, barely breathing, laying on the ground.  He hoists her over his shoulder to his car and takes her to the hospital. He feels he's likely to be in deep do-do when he has to explain this to his wife Edna. Doctor Sydia Garrison who specializes in surgery at Medical University of South Carolina is sickened by the barbaric assault on this young teenager.  A local news reporter, Janice Porter, gets a tip from a fellow who works at the hospital, so she quickly attempts to be the lead reporter and goes to the hospital.  There she sees the infamous Detective Dan Hammer who has a strong dislike for reporters, which only hampers her a bit to get a report to her boss. Very soon, as the police search the area where George found the mutilated girl, another young girl's body is found.  This leads to FBI Agent Harry Wright into the fast moving investigation of the serial killer tagged, ""The Mutilator.""  This is very compelling story, with the characters well defined, in fast reading style of writing by the author.

0765329603,Books,"[0, 0]",5,"Review courtesy of Dark Faerie TalesQuick & Dirty: Three is my favorite book in the gritty Article 5 trilogy thanks to Simmons&#8217; flawless delivery of both heartbreaking losses and moments of incredible tenderness. Fans of both the dystopian and New Adult romance genres will definitely want to read this exceptional story!Opening Sentence: The dream was changing.The Review:Ember and Chase have gone through hell to be together. The Moral Militia. The Rehabilitation Center. Secrets and betrayals by people they once considered friends. The number of people they&#8217;ve watched die. Yet nothing has come as close to truly separating them as the emotional scars they both carry after shooting a young guard in Chicago while rescuing Rebecca.After all, it&#8217;s not like they can take a time out to talk about Chase&#8217;s darkest secrets or Ember&#8217;s greatest fear. With the only safe house they knew of destroyed, their small group of survivors from the MM attack is scrambling to find a place to recover. Ember, Chase, Rebecca, Sean and four others have set out from a temporary shelter to find supplies and a better hiding spot for those injured during the tunnel collapse. No one is happy about leaving the weakest, virtually defenseless members of their group behind and they all feel the pressure to return by the promised deadline only a few days away.  Ember, Chase and the rest have barely had time to sleep, let alone hold any private soul-bearing conversations and their hope is fading fast. The only thing keeping any of them going is the hope that Tucker and the two carriers who went with him can find a rebellion post in the Red Zone.The news from Tucker isn&#8217;t good when he finally makes contact with Ember though. The first rebellion post is deserted. The news that one of the carriers, the name given to members of the rebellion who deliver messages between posts, is missing is even worse. Tucker is clearly worried about the situation, however most of his concern seems to be focused on Ember &#8211; something which makes things with Chase even tenser. Despite their issues, it&#8217;s clear Ember loves Chase and vice versa. Still, she can&#8217;t deny her feelings for the guy who both betrayed Chase and murdered her mother. She doesn&#8217;t want to be concerned about his safety or feel relief at hearing his voice&#8230;except she does. Tucker has proven himself several times over and Ember unwillingly feels a softening in her heart toward him.Rather than think too long about the odd Tucker situation, her strained friendship with Rebecca or even the worry she feels over Chase pulling away from her, Ember instead focuses on a trail of subtle clues possibly left by the rebel group known as Three. Ember is certain Three is the key to unifying the rebellion groups &#8211; the only hope they have to defeat the President and his Bureau of Reformation. The only problem? No one knows for sure if Three exists or how to get in contact with them. Ember is sure they are getting closer to the elusive group and is convinced they just need more time to find them. For as much guilt and concern Ember felt up to this point for leaving the injured people behind, she&#8217;s pretty quick to talk the others into following the trail of clues rather than returning by the promised deadline. I understand her reasoning &#8211; finding Three would benefit them much more than simply turning around &#8211; but this still seems like a harsh decision. It reflects how much she&#8217;s changed since Article 5, how all of them have become hardened to the world of Statutes and murder sentences for single mothers.This change is further emphasized when Ember&#8217;s group is ambushed. These may not be MM members yet she reminds herself that anyone attacking her is her enemy. At least it appears that way, until the other group&#8217;s leader is revealed to be a man from Chase&#8217;s past. A dangerous man who has the power to hurt Chase more than he already has. Afraid Chase will push her even further away if she reveals her true feelings regarding the guy; Ember instead stays silent on the sudden reappearance of the man she trusts less than Tucker. The only good news is the rest of the people with him are rebels who survived another safe house attack.The story, which was in no way slow up to this point, really starts to fly once Ember&#8217;s group meets up with these survivors. It&#8217;s hard to talk about the rest of the story without giving anything away though. What I can say is there are a lot of hard lessons learned when they eventually do find the mysterious Three. Secret agendas and more deaths &#8211; several of which left me a sobbing mess &#8211; keep the tension almost unbearably high for the rest of the book, making it very difficult to put it down for even a moment. There are double and triple crosses, but the killer is that there aren&#8217;t purely good or purely evil aspects for most characters or their actions. The will to survive can make people do things they never imagined they could to make it one more hour, one more day. There are plot twists I saw coming and others that completely surprised me.None of the relationships in Three are simple, but there were a number of sweet moments that warmed my heart. Ember and Chase&#8217;s relationship is definitely one of the more beautiful ones I&#8217;ve read in a while. They&#8217;ve both changed so much since the first book, yet their love has only deepened. The tenderness Simmons is able to portray between Ember and Chase, and to a greater extent Rebecca and Sean, is refreshing and unique in Young Adult and New Adult pieces where physical attraction is the primary focus. Finally, I&#8217;d be lying if I didn&#8217;t admit how heartbreaking the ending was for me. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any other way Simmons could&#8217;ve done her remarkable story justice though.Three may be the first book I&#8217;ve ever whole-heartedly and universally recommended for everyone with no thought as to what genre it should be placed in. Though there are sexual situations and violence in the trilogy, the overall story belongs among social commentary classics like Fahrenheit 451.Notable Scene:&#8220;Why are they here?&#8221; I asked, suddenly angry at them &#8212; the dead people. They shouldn&#8217;t have scared me. I&#8217;d seen worse. Much worse.&#8220;Let&#8217;s go get some air,&#8221; he said.I peeled his fingers away.&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they clear out like everyone else?&#8221; There wasn&#8217;t any sign of violence; it was like they&#8217;d laid down to sleep and not woken up, and for some reason this bothered me even more.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;&#8220;They should have evacuated.&#8221; The government had cleared this area years ago.I swiped at my arms again, feeling the tickle on my skin.&#8220;Maybe they didn&#8217;t want to.&#8221; He chewed his bottom lip, looking into the room.His words shifted my fear to something more solid, something stronger. I&#8217;d had it backward. These people hadn&#8217;t given up, they&#8217;d made their stand. Maybe that was all we really got: a choice to control our own fate.FTC Advisory: Tor Teen/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Three.

Her mother is paranoid and Karissa believes she is somewhat mentally unstable.  She is also a recluse. Karissa meets our hero Naz when he is in her classroom speaking to one of her professors.  Shaking him down actually but Karissa does not know this. And that is how they meet. Naz isn't just some handsome stranger.  He is a very dangerous man. And he wants Karissa. This book ends in a cliffhanger that was so delicious!I devoured every word of this book.  I loved Naz so much and I was a little afraid of him too.  I especially loved how the author did not do the insta love connection.  Naz's possessiveness comes to a slow boil and you are just like the lobster...you don't know its to late until...well its to late.  Karissa is a bit immature and a bit trusting but it is believable for her age and situation.  I mean what young girl on her own wouldn't want to be around a dark and sexy man.  And he is dark.  And dangerous.  And sexy.  But the author does a great job of allowing the reader to learn these things along with Karissa.  We are not told what a bad ass he is.  We are not told how violent and deadly.  But we learn and we realize like someone in her shoes. Karissa had realistic and believable reactions to everything Naz did.  And Naz...oh man...you do not walk away from this man.  I am praying that the author keeps up his alpha domineering ways in the next book. I want the dark.

1572246456,Books,"[1, 1]",3,"The author says he is both a scientist and a spiritual seeker. Judging by this book he is 90% scientist and only 10% spiritual seeker. The only reason he gives for rejecting the materialist world view is that it is depressing and renders life meaningless. That's a good reason to be a spiritual seeker, but does not provide evidence for a different world view.The author believes life is meaningless without a belief in life in after death, so he writes about paranormal phenomena, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. The problem is that he presents no compelling evidence for these things. His scientific side requires him to hedge and examine evidence for spiritual phenomena from a skeptical viewpoint. The author treats telekinesis, clairvoyance, telepathy, remote viewing, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. But after examining the &#34;evidence&#34; in light if the author's scientific &#34;weasel words,&#34; you are less likely to believe in these things than to accept them as real. Even the author's single so-called PSI experience is very weak and unconvincing.The author states that &#34;after death contacts&#34; would provide the most compelling evidence for an afterlife, and then writes a chapter that concludes not only that there is NO evidence for such, but it is just too hard to study &#34;scientifically.&#34; The theme runs throughout the book that science has led us astray, yet we have no choice but to use the scientific method to set us back on the right path. As a practicing scientist with a reputation to uphold, the author attempts to both criticize science and appease his colleagues at the same time. How can the author believe that science is at once the problem AND the solution?The author's message boils down to this: &#34;I want to believe in an afterlife, and in spite of the lack of evidence I WILL believe because the alternative is too depressing (meanwhile, I will look forward to the day when science gives me a good reason to believe)..","05 24, 2014",A21ATVN2BJC01J,Fran,Not At All Compelling,1400889600

Just like every early stage revolutions, Big Data has been equally misunderstood even among tech and business saavy people. For many Big Data , Data Science, Analytics are all interchangeable terminologies. This book takes care of that and lot more. Everyone will learn quiet a lot about Big data from this book,but specifically it is targeted for The Decision Makers.The most interesting feature in the book are the real world corporate examples ; stories to emphasize the point of view that makes it an interesting read for everyone. The slim 175 Pages is split across 8 Chapters:CHAPTERS:1. Why Big Data Is Important to You and Your Organization?2. How Big Data will change your job, Your Company and Your Industry?3. Developing a Big Data Strategy4. The Human Side Of Big Data5. Technology For Big Data6. What It takes to Succeed With Big Data7. What You Can Learn from Start-ups And Online Firms8. What You Can Learn From Large Companies: Big Data and Analytics 3.0.NOW FOR THE DETAILS :Chapter One : This is the superficial section of the book; The author does not use the boring Twitter data feed, Enormous Facebook data as an example which seems to be the staple diet for all Big data articles. Explains the difference between traditional analysis Vs Big Data . Cautions rightfully about Vendors who use the term ""big data"" on totally unrelated topics so can get your attention, ear and business.Chapter Two And Three: Goes over who will be impacted by Big data (Ex : If you move things, If you sell items, If Money is involved) and how . The nice examples involves Scenarios so everyone can relate to his business in some form or Other. This is a primer on the larger objectives around which you build your Big Data strategies . Do you want to save Money? Or is it that you want to introduce new product ? and so on. The sections are backed by tons of examples ( For that Matter, the entire book is one large story telling examples).Chapter Four And Five :  It is in a nutshell about ""Data Scientist"". Who they are, and more importantly who is 'not a data scientist', The Shortage of getting resources, how it can be solved. If you want to be a data scientist, read this section, It explains how sizzling hot you are going to be. For a company , be cautious. The chapters go around  Hadoop and the technology that goes with it. Hadoop, Map reduce, how Big data will coexist with Data warehouse and so on. As an IT person , you should find this very useful.Chapter Six / Seven /Eight : Is a little more deeper analysis of the factors to have a successful Big data . The Data you need, the leadership you need, the type of Human resources need etc. The chapters are  glowing eulogy about the successful companies like Linkedin and the takeaway companies can leverage. If you are decision maker every of these chapters are interesting.Having said that, there is a better book on the same topic, which isBig Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and ThinkOn a personal note, My interest on big data spiked after the Harvard Business Review article which predicted Data Scientist as the sexiest job of the 21st Century.

This book felt like it was written as an erotic suspense with lots of twists and turns. I was gripped by the story from the beginning and could not put it down. I think it should have been said that this is a student/teacher romance. BUT don&#8217;t allow preconceived notions to let that turn you off&#8230;. trust me, this isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re thinking. This book wasn&#8217;t what I was expecting and I couldn&#8217;t be happier about it.In the beginning, we meet Addison (Addy) and it&#8217;s pretty clear she is in a mental institution. Her doctor &#8220;Doc&#8221; is trying to get her to talk and she seems to be in some kind of psychosis where she won&#8217;t speak. I was really excited that the book just throws you off the cliff and you have to try and figure out what is happening. From the beginning all you know is that something is wrong and you want to know how she got there. The most intriguing part of the beginning of the book is that Addy keeps thinking she&#8217;s alone and &#8220;he&#8221; is gone. The first three chapters of this book set an amazing tone of the story that follows. Addy was a dark and sexual character to get inside. I was captivated by her maturity even though she was young. I loved how she was so bold and not embarrassed by her body or her desires.Mr. McKendrick wasn&#8217;t at all what I was expecting. When someone says student/teacher romance I immediately think the guy is going to be a sleazy creep. I assume he is preying on an innocent girl or taking advantage of a vulnerability. I can honestly say those thoughts NEVER crossed my mind with him. I felt like from the beginning he was trying to thwart Addy&#8217;s advances. He was very clear that she was his student and it wasn&#8217;t going to happen. He kept his distance and told her &#8220;no&#8221; repeatedly. I loved that he wasn&#8217;t your typical guy looking for a young piece of a**. He was a man, who&#8217;s heart connected to Addy&#8217;s. I fell in love with Mr. McKendrick and I am not even the least bit ashamed. He does reveal his first name in the book, but it&#8217;s such an intimate scene I&#8217;ll let you find that out on your own.I am not even a little sorry at how much this book turned me on. I think I even said I was going to make my husband tell me &#8220;no&#8221; over and over again after I finished this book. I have never been so turned on in my life by a man trying to stop a woman&#8217;s sexual advances. The tease, the build up, and the sex are 5 of 5 stars. My vagina and I were totally in agreement that this book was a sexual beast.For me, this book was an A. The story was suspenseful and captivating and I couldn&#8217;t stop reading. I was wrapped in the mystery of what happened to Addy and why Mr. McKendrick was missing. I didn&#8217;t see how this book was going to play out from the beginning, so I loved that it kept me on edge. I read this book in a day and was angry at myself for finishing it so fast. I don&#8217;t know about the author&#8217;s other books, but this blew me away. If you are looking for book that has a lot of heat, and a bit of a thriller aspect to it, then this is it!

Stationed at Pearl Harbor, Morris Sullivan owes his survival to Robert Dobbins, a black seaman who died pulling his comrades from the water. Seeking closure, Morris is determined to thank Robert&#8217;s family for his sacrifice, but his effort to honor a fallen hero blooms into a romance that will define the man he becomes and challenge everything he believes.Spanning the better part of five decades, A Life Apart, is a tedious historical, but under that it is a heartbreakingly beautiful novel of prejudice, strength, forgiveness and love that defies convention. I personally found Marlow&#8217;s peppering of the story with tenuously relevant headlines from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s distracting, but the depth and earnestness of the love triangle she created between Morris, Beatrice and Agnes provided a powerfully moving thesis that struck me to the core.","05 3, 2014",A7WNQN5D1E4HW,Erin Davies,A Life Apart: A Novel,1399075200

The further I read the more interesting and natural the story became. I loved the brothers and roommates in their own ways but I had a particular fondness for George and the prank wars between him and Kyle. Dean seemed like he was just trying to look out for Kyle but in doing so he didn't leave a lot of room for her to make her own decisions and I think it was actually doing more harm than good.I still have questions about the night that Kyle regrets the most in her life it just seemed liked we didn't get a lot of details of the aftermath or in fact the aftermath wasn't as serious as it seemed to be to affect Kyle in such a strong way. I was also a little confused about her family's reaction to Nick. One minute it seemed like they wanted her to stay away from him and the next it was like they just wanted her to move on from her previous relationship and get a boyfriends already.I loved Kyle but frankly he's still sort of a mystery to me. He's totally swoonworthy, I mean really a British accent, yes please. He is also patient and kind but persistent in his efforts to make Kyle understand how much he cares about her.Now can we talk about the last chapter and the ending? I have so many questions about Nick's sudden 360, what happened, what's going on? Then the way the book ended, say what? I was not expecting that at all and now I'm biting my nails to find out what happens next.Over all I think this was a great debut and I could see the growth of the author from the beginning to the end of the book.

0393239357,Books,"[3, 5]",5,"Much about the world always stays the same but in the background there are often big trends that are hard to see when in the thick of it.  In the Second Machine Age, authors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee try to distinguish the forrest from the trees and discuss whats happening in the new digital age and how it is affecting us all economically.  This book discusses business trends and what is happening in information technology and analyzes it from the viewpoint of economics.  It gives perspective on the labour market, the rise of inequality, the needs of the new economy and the policies we should consider in this new environment.  It is always sensible and does its best to discuss issues evenly.  Despite us all living in this new technological age it is difficult to take a step back and try to get a true appreciation of whats going on is challenging.  This book aids in that process and helps frame the issues for the reader to think about.The authors start by considering human progress through our history.  They show how population growth as well as our social developement (as considered by Ian Morris in &#34;Why the West Rules for Now&#34;) has grown exponentially from the first industrial revolution and they discuss the technology and process that got us here.  The authors then discuss their experiences in the present and the journey they took in one of google's automated vehicles.  The author's argue that such applications of technology were not possible in the recent past but the exponential growth of computational power has enabled us to start doing things that seemed impossible just a few years ago.  They discuss the amazing progress in robotics and AI in the last few years and how this progress is just the beginning.  They give some metrics about how much information is getting digitized and how with the price of memory and processing going to 0 how much we have increased in terms of cataloguing.  In particular statistics like 10% of all the photos ever taken were taken last year with more photos taken every 2 minutes than in the entire 19th century.  The digitization of our daily lives is hard to fathom but when put in such terms the magnitude is astounding.  The authors then discuss innovation.  Recently the limits of human progress has been a hot topic of debate.  Robert Gordon recently questioned whether growth was sustainable and has argued the current growth trends and productivity enhancing innovations pale in comparison to the technologies of upheaval in the past.  The authors argue against this perspective and discuss the idea that growth comes from recombining old good ideas into better new ideas and how given how many more people are being brought into the new economy with the barriers to entry being low in the digital economy meaning we are in a new digital age of progress and we are at the beginning still.  The authors discuss how GDP as a measure is insufficient and how there is enormous consumer surplus created from recent technologies.  They discuss how the economy has migrated from rival to non-rival meaning that in the new economy the things we often value the most have negligible marginal cost of production.  An example being Wikipedia might destroy GDP by removing the need for labour for encyclopaedia britannica but has created massive consumer surplus for people at large.  The authors discuss how the new economy creates enormous economies of scale and as a result the distribution of incomes will be fundamentally altered as gains are not attributed to relative productivity but go to the very top at the expense of the rest.  The repurcussions being that average and median incomes continue to diverge and there is little natural reversion in that process.  The authors discuss what they think are ways for people to adapt to the new economy.  They give basic examples of how right now, at the core, people using machines are the ones enabled we are not in a machines purely replace people world.  The authors are very even and do not conclude that supply side innovations naturally create demand for labour and how fast innovation can run the risk of constantly leaving a portion of the population behind the production frontier.  At the same time the authors discuss ways in which we can address some of the adverse consequences of the digitization of the economy through intelligent policy.The Second Machine Age is a must read for those thinking about how the world has been changing since the dawn of the internet.  It is hard to not be convinced by much of what the author's discuss and the book is full of insight the reader can easily take away after reading.  It gives food for thought about what skills we should always be thinking about adding as well as broad social policy we might need for the future that has been different from the past.  This is one of the best books I have read in a while.","02 15, 2014",A2LM1HE1HAXMVB,A. Menon,Excellent overview of developements in and repurcussions of digital age we live in,1392422400

You do have to place close attention to the background character explanations to get various relationships. This enables you to follow certain sequences. Admittedly, the author could have a bit more clarity in this area. Eventually, though, you figure it out.The problem I have with a series is when you have to wait for the final installment. It's rather a let down. But, I did read the conclusive segment should occur sometime January, 2014. I can hope. I have one issue with the second book that did follow a conventional mind set that bugs me.  Nicky(Neil's teammate and openly gay character) rants to Neil about the only way Neil will have a happy life is having a significant other.  Otherwise, this dooms Neil to a joyless life. I've commented on this issue previously in other critiques. Are you telling me that even thought I have decent caring friends, a purposeful life, a loving relationship with myself open toward the other  that if I 'don't have someone' I'm doomed to a miserable life.? Listen up. There are people who lead a happy existence with caring attachments and are ok. Don't get me wrong. It is desirable to have a partner but not a need to prevent a fulfilling life. I'll stop now.Ah, don't let me distract from the fact that I still consider the second book highly recommendable.","01 4, 2014",A3Q8AOCIRVC78B,Blaltimore Phil,"Ok, I'm left hanging  since the last book is yet not available.",1388793600
B00D7Z4FW4,Books,"[2, 2]",4,"Erin McCarthy brings another wonderful New Adult contemporary romance to life with Believe, the third book in the True Believers Series. Two young people, damaged by their pasts find a friendship that relieves their feelings of isolation. As Robin and Phoenix find true acceptance with each other their feelings grow and they find love, even though neither believes they are deserving of it. Robin, a college student who became the campus party girl made a drunken mistake one night that will change her life and possibly destroy her best friend. As it haunts her every day, she isolates herself from those around her and vows never to drink again. Enter Phoenix, just released from prison, alone, with nothing but the borrowed clothes on his back, and a couch to sleep on at his cousins&#8217; house. Phoenix seems to be in control of himself at all times, until any type of spark ignites the rage he keeps bottled up inside. Will these two find the support they need from each other or will they need to face their demons alone?Filled with angst, anger, guilt, and the tenuous threads of love, Believe is the story of two individuals who must learn to love themselves and accept that their own shortcomings are their greatest enemies while accepting that they are worthy of love that is given freely.Erin McCarthy has done a wonderful job creating characters that feel real and could be someone one could find on any campus when first cut loose into the world. Using the POVs of both main characters further illustrates her ability to give life to her tale. The fact that I wanted to shake them both one minute and hug them the next, means I was in the moment from start to finish. Her world is like a tour of campus life, the friendships and bonds, the turmoil of being a young person out on their own in a world they were not expecting.

As a matter of fact, what she discovers about her family makes her literally ill with horror and fear.  For she mourns her father who loved her dearly but she also mourns the man as tyrant and killer who has tortured and killed thousands; at least he is responsible for these acts even if he has not literally carried them out himself in a single-handed way.  The word her friends use about the children&#8217;s fairy tales and practices of her father&#8217;s rule is &#8220;barbaric,&#8221; a painful word that sears through her mind and feelings for days and weeks.  How does one cope with her father&#8217;s guilt, that which took the lives of families and friends of people she actually knows in America?Now Laila is in America.  Several people are interested in her, the man who is attempting to convince her mother to cooperate with CIA interests, the man who doesn&#8217;t trust Laila initially but eventually will come to accept her at face value, and a normal American boy who wants to write a journalistic account of her father&#8217;s life and her experiences in the nameless country from which she is in exile.  Its these relationships that evolve in dramatic ways that cause her to grow up fast.  Whether the reader thinks this evolution is healthy and good for Laila is left up to his or her imagination!We learn that her Uncle is now ruling the land Laila once called &#8220;home.&#8221;  He spends his time frantically calling Lails&#8217;s mother.  Over time, Laila experiments with her new life in the United States, dressing like other girls do, dancing, and cultivating friendships that are &#8220;normal&#8221; for Americans but very, very different from what she knew before.  Meanwhile, she learns the truth about her family&#8217;s place of &#8220;royalty,&#8221; and that changes her forever.  Her choices after that will affect her family and her former country forever!The author tells us, after the story ends, the seeds that planted this unforgettable story in her head and what she wished the reader to experience throughout the account and afterward.  J. C. Carleson brilliantly succeeds in her quest and the reader may reach his or her own decision regarding same.  This is a must read for American teenagers and adults, a side of life that could be any teenager in the Middle East or America, a side that calls for momentous decisions that could have planned or unforeseen consequences for history.

Um, yes please!Audrey is a wallflower, but wants so much more from her life than what her parents have planned for her. She longs for adventure and an escape. She certainly dives head first into adventure when Ethan Jagger/Locke shows up injured at her window. I liked Audrey, she has guts and I admired her determination to enjoy her life and escape the box her parents were trying to put her in. But I found her actions rather puzzling in the first third of the book. I'm not sure how much she knew Ethan previously, but her grandfather was just assaulted by some ruffians and she up and leaves with a man she barely knows who is clearly running from someone. Then when she realises that Ethan is running from Bow Street, she continues on her 'adventure' with him. It just came across as kind of reckless and foolish, to be honest. Fair enough, I understood her motivations, but I read it with a raised eyebrow. Once Ethan and Audrey's relationship develops, the eyebrow lowered and it made sense that she stuck by him and defended him.Ethan has a criminal past that he's trying to put behind him. He wants nothing more than to let go of the past and mend his relationship with his brother, unfortunately that past does not want to let go of him. When he's falsely accused of murdering a Marquess, he's forced to literally run for his life. Ethan likes Audrey, but he never intended to bring her with him. As they spend more time together though,he realises that she's an unusual young lady and there's a lot more to her than meets the eye. Ethan has done a lot in his past that he regrets and he wants to become a better man, the man his father intended for him to be.I enjoyed Ethan and Audrey's relationship. I thought her optimism and innocence balanced his cynicism and made him a bit less jaded. Ethan is a good man at heart, and Audrey sees that man.I could get a little lost with all the characters, at times. It's part of a series and can be read as a stand alone, but there are a lot of characters who are clearly in the previous books in the series and it could be difficult to remember who was who. Although, it doesn't affect the reading of this book particularly.Overall, I liked it but I didn't love it. The characters held a lot of promise but fell a bit flat for me. I was left feeling luke warm about this, although I'm interested to read some of the other character's stories in previous books of the series.*I received a review copy form the publisher, via NetGalley, for my honest opinion.

1565112008,Books,"[0, 0]",3,"Now that Dark Horse Comic&#8217;s tenure with the Star Wars license is starting to wind down, I wanted to take some time to go back and reread some of the bigger, bolder titles that have seen release throughout the years.  Like many longtime readers, I&#8217;m immeasurably bummed about the move of the comics from the Horse to the Mouse House of Marvel (I&#8217;m really not looking forward to the Vader/Wolvie crossover); and &#8211; in order to keep it real &#8211; I&#8217;m revisiting some of the yarns that made waves.One of the first big breakthroughs was something called DARK EMPIRE.  It went on to have a few sequels, but &#8211; for my tastes &#8211; I honestly didn&#8217;t much care for this tale even when it first hit the shelves.  It isn&#8217;t that I disliked the idea of exploring an Emperor Palpatine resurrected in the days of the New Republic fumbling to establish a firm footing; it&#8217;s just that so much of Tom Veitch&#8217;s story felt like character retreads.More after the break &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Essentially, the story that unfolds here is that the Empire isn&#8217;t quite as dead as our heroes &#8211; Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa-Solo, Han Solo, and more &#8211; long believed it to be.  In fact, some lingering elements in the inner galaxies have gone a long way toward re-establishing their own union, putting the New Republic back on its heels and having to fight in smaller isolated conflicts once more.  Naturally, this brings our gang back together, and they&#8217;re rushed to the front lines in order to give yet one more &#8216;New Hope&#8217; street cred with faltering worlds.Lo and behold, our young Skywalker &#8211; now a bit older &#8211; discovers that the Emperor (aka Darth Sidious) has been resurrected (in a sense).  It would seem that his life essence has become a part of the living Dark Side &#8211; much like Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker have merged with the Light Side elements; all the former Palpatine need do is pull a younger version of himself out of a clone canister and &#8211; viola &#8211; new Emperor!  Now, he&#8217;s using some massive new weapons known as &#8216;World Devastators&#8217; to crush planets that won&#8217;t bend to his will.Just as was the thematic undercurrent for the Luke Skywalker character in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI (and many, many Extended Universe tales since then), this new Emperor wants to turn our hero to the Dark Side.  What makes this tale a bit different is that the Jedi seemingly does embrace it, though he admits to readers over and over again that he&#8217;s done so only to get closer to Palpatine so that he can inevitably defeat him.  Leia, Han, and the others don&#8217;t see as clearly what Luke&#8217;s motivations are, so they spend the bulk of their time trying to contact the Jedi Master so they can &#8216;reclaim&#8217; him for their side &#8230; and, so far as I can tell, that about wraps it up.DARK EMPIRE is a worthy read, but it&#8217;s nothing that really smacks of originality or epicness (if you&#8217;ll pardon my creation of the word).  The Emperor is the same &#8211; as are all of our regular players &#8211; so nothing new added to the mix pretty much leaves this tale tasting like something we&#8217;ve all had before.  That in itself isn&#8217;t enough reason to resist the story&#8217;s obvious temptations &#8211; could it be that Luke won&#8217;t survive the Emperor&#8217;s machinations this time? &#8211; which is why I basically deem it worth a read but little else.  Plus, DARK EMPIRE has a weird artistic template; it&#8217;s almost as if illustrator Cam Kennedy (who does terrific work) made some curious decision to color the worlds of George Lucas monochromatically, and, for the life of me, I can&#8217;t figure out how anyone thought that was a good idea.  (???)  One of the most enduring qualities of STAR WARS is how different the various worlds and machines and droids look from one to another, so casting so very many panels in as few color choices as possible makes no narrative much less commercial sense.Heck, even the long-rumored dead Boba Fett shows up for what plays out like an almost obligator appearance, one meant to recapture the magic of the bounty hunters glory days instead of adding legitimacy to the web being spun here.  I like Boba Fett.  I get most fanboys like Boba Fett.  But his appearance here?  It just didn&#8217;t need to be.RECOMMENDED.  I&#8217;m smitten with most of the Dark Horse&#8217;s adventures from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away; still, there&#8217;s something about DARK EMPIRE that just underwhelmed me.  There were a few moments of greatness &#8211; Luke&#8217;s commitment to kinda/sorta bringing the Force into balance; Leia&#8217;s love for family despite the obvious hardships; Han&#8217;s ribbing of his brother-in-law; etc. &#8211; but most of them underscore relationships already so firmly established that there was little new brought to the game.  Otherwise, much of this tale flew on autopilot, and it was hardly as DARK as it could&#8217;ve been.  Good &#8211; worth a read &#8211; but far from great.","06 30, 2014",AYG1U47VFZ165,"E.

Lilac and Tarver are the two survivors from a spaceliner that crashes. She is a spoiled rich girl and he is poor soldier, but they are the only two people on a seemingly abandoned planet. The work together to find safety and help and despite their differences, they fall for each other.I thought the novel was well-written. The authors did a nice job of painting a picture in my head of the world the characters live in. There was also a captivating plot as the characters encounter strange happenings on the planet. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a love story though and I thought that even though rich girl and poor boy fall in love is somewhat clich&eacute;, the love story was well done.

0345527380,Books,"[0, 0]",5,"In A Chain of Thunder, Jeff Shaara continues his series on the War in the West bringing us the campaign which opened the Mississippi and introduces us to some very interesting characters.  Through his usual narrative, there comes some clarity which has left Civil War novices confused about the Vicksburg Campaign and the novel stands as a great introduction for those people interested in something besides the War in the East.  The second part of his series is a welcome addition not only to the bookshelves of Civil War buffs, but the literary world as well.Jeff Shaara is a New York Times bestseller and began his career with the work preceding his father&#8217;s called Gods and Generals and finished the story with The Last Full Measure.  Shaara has won numerous accolades for his works on the revolution called Rise to Rebellion and The Glorious Cause.  After his series on the Civil War in the West, he will be pursuing the Texas conflict and the Korean War.For the first time in his career, Jeff Shaara has given us the outlook of a woman.  She does not have just one chapter, but many telling the story of the civilians who had to hide out in the caves and sometimes gave their services as nurses.  The narrative of the hospitals is gruesome and not for the faint of heart, but even more so, the narrative of life in the caves is even worse.  There are some points in literature which stick with you for the rest of your life and his description of life in the caves and the starvation of the men and women of the city of Vicksburg is one of those passages.  Whether it be the slaughter of the horses so they could eat all the way down to killing dogs for food, the disturbing image comes when there is no reservation about eating these animals.  Even the conditions of the high command of the Confederate army is deplorable.  In this volume, Shaara chooses to use Pemberton as the voice of the Confederate command structure instead of Johnston and rightfully so.  Pemberton was more the defender of Vicksburg than any other commander.  He does, however, give Pemberton the same treatment his father gave Longstreet in The Killer Angels.  He has taken a character which was not always in good light and given him a favorable view.  In the end, you feel sorry for Pemberton and wonder what he could have done to further his fight.  But knowing there was nothing for him to do was quite sad and some say could change the opinions of people about the man.  On the Union side,  we have the regulars from the last book, A Blaze of Glory, with Private Bauer from the 17th Wisconsin and General Sherman.  Something, however, can be said about reading a book with the opposition has the upper hand constantly in the campaign.  While there are small battles throughout the siege which the Union army loses, there is something in the back of the reader&#8217;s mind saying that they still have the upper hand in the situation which makes this book a bit more history than novel.  Which brings me to the major point of my review.  A Chain of Thunder is a good book, but is more nonfiction novel than an actual historical fiction book.  I learned more about the Vicksburg Campaign in this book than I have learned from any of his other works and once again, Shaara shines when he only has to worry about a single campaign or battle instead of stretching the work over a few years.I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction because while being such, it is quite different from what the standard is for those types of works.  The detail in which is gives to the campaign of Vicksburg is quite good and while he makes the reader feel sympathy for the Confederate army, there is still an even divide between the Union and Confederate accounts.  Jeff Shaara&#8217;s War in the West series is a very welcome addition to my own Civil War library and should be a welcome addition to any other history fan as well.Matthew Bartlett - Author, Gettysburg Chronicle","06 23, 2014",A3RZ9RN5W4WBPN,Matthew Bartlett,General Pemberton Finally Gets His Due Diligence,1403481600

This one tastes much better. However I've adapted to both in taste but found this one good right off. Trouble is a jar isn't going to last a full month as I'd hoped.

I feel pretty mislead by the other reviewers, which is rare. Maybe they have been at Trader Joe's so long they forgot what typical food is like for the average schmo, but if you've had the average ginger snap you can buy in any grocery store, you've had something as good (or possibly better) than these.

I can see why some of the reviewers said they were overcooked, they are a bit dark and could qualify as overdone, but I could also get past that. The ""triple ginger"" description seems an overreach - the ground ginger is not very strong as ginger powder goes, and you can't taste the ginger puree at all - it might be apple puree for all that one could taste. But I could get past that too. What was really the last straw was that I ate several of these Nilla wafer-sized cookies without a single chunk of ginger in it! I then took a much closer inspection, thinking maybe somehow I got a defective batch - and found that if I ate extremely slowly, chewing the cookie a good 100 times without swallowing to try to find some texture in it, there was a tiny rubbery bit or two in each that when bit directly onto, tasted like crystalized ginger. Really, I can't believe this led to all the rave reviews here - an ingredient that makes it into the name of the cookie, and yet is so tiny one could easily eat the whole package and never notice it's there. This is a total rip-off, because really, crystalized ginger is not that expensive, it would be easy enough to add several real chunks (and by chunk I mean a piece of crystalized ginger about 2-4mm square, nothing enormous) to each cookie. I can't believe people could get so excited about such a bland, sweet but overcooked, very dry small cookie, with ginger pieces in it about the circumference of the very tip of a pen. I can see why some people said they were good with ice cream or as part of a dessert, but throw a graham cracker in there with a sprinkle of brown sugar and a ash of ground ginger and it would taste exactly the same for a fraction of the cost.I feel like an idiot paying nearly $19 for two tins of ginger snaps that were no better, and maybe a little bit worse, than I could have bought in my local store for $4 total. Buy crystalized ginger itself, or make it, for a fraction of the price and a whole lot less saturated fat, all the health benefits of ginger, and a lot more flavor. That's what I'll be doing the next time I have a sweet ginger craving. (And for those that eat ice cream, chunks of it cut up are amazing in it - I've had it in peach sorbet, and the taste could make you swoon.)","01 9, 2014",AVM45CGFXTYTG,TropicalFish,What crystalized ginger?,1389225600

B00AKVU5KY,Grocery,"[6, 6]",5,"Coming from a 1st generation Korean family (meaning my parents emigrated from Korea), I grew up as one would expect in a Korean household.  That includes culture, beliefs, and food.  For a good portion of my life (almost 2 decades), I grew up on eating instant Korean noodles.  This ranges from the Neoguri, to Jin Ramyun, to Chappaghetti, to Kimchi Ramyun, etc.  If it was a Korean brand of instant noodle, I've probably eaten it.  It wasn't until recently I was getting tired of the same old noodles and wanted to try something new.  I drove to my local Korean supermarket and bought several ""new brands"" of instant Korean noodles, with Shin Ramyun Black being one of them.For those of you familiar with the original Shin Ramyun, I can tell you that Shin Ramyun Black is quite a bit more flavorful.  The Black version comes with 3 packets of seasoning/mix vs the regular version's two packets.  These packets consist of the soup base, the vegetable mix, and the ""sul-long tang"" soup base.  For those of you that don't know what that is, ""sul-long-tang"" is a Korean soup made typically of beef bones and sometimes beef slices.  Traditionally this soup is white/cream colored because of the long (several hours) simmering effect of boiling beef bones.  The marrow eventually gets cooked into the water, creating a beefy creamy/milky flavor.  In my opinion, this is what makes the Black version taste so much different than the original.  Aside from that, the vegetable mix contains chunkier vegetables with a small bits of dehydrated beef.  Personally I think the flavor of this soup is superior to the original... but it comes at a cost....For those of you that are curious about this product, know that it is nearly double the price of the original Shin Ramyun.  I guess Nong Shim considers them ""premium"" noodles (as the packaging states), but is it worth it?  You have to ask yourself, is one single packet worth the double price?  Not really despite the tasty flavor.  However, I ended up getting these on an Amazon Lightning deal for 50% off, so they ended up being the same price as the regular cup noodle version, that's why I took a stab at it.  So if you really want to try these, you can give it a go either on Amazon or your local Asian grocery.","01 20, 2014",A12B7ZMXFI6IXY,"Hyoun Kim ""Faluzure""","Awesome Flavor, A Bit Overpriced - Blame Nong Shim's Marketing",1390176000

The chunks of tomato are plentiful. And because it only has 10 calories per two tablespoons, it is a perfect compliment to chips if you are trying to watch your diet.You can actually see evidence of &#34;fire roasted&#34; in the salsa. There are blackened pieces of skin in salsa, which not only help add to the flavor but also add visual interest. This salsa is also somewhat darker than your traditional salsa, due to the fire-roasted contents.You can add this to your favorite meals as well, wherever a salsa is desired or required, for a slightly different flavor. The fire-roasted falvoring compliments beef and chicken rather well.As a &#34;medium&#34; salsa, this is somewhat spicy, but not incredibly &#34;hot&#34;.

I actually did want to drink more tea, if only I could find one that I truly enjoyed. I then moved on to other teas recommended by people that were tea 'experts' so to speak. It was after trying some of those varieties, that I saw such a marked difference in taste and enjoyment. I was now on the path to consuming more tea!! Being health conscious and watching what I eat and drink, as well as, having a daily exercise regimen, I started to look at green tea as a daily beverage option. I had done quite a bit of reading on the subject and as I take various supplements, use protein powder, etc., I wanted to add the benefits of green tea to my regular menu. Try as I might, I wasn't able to find a green tea that had a substantial and pleasing flavor. I had tried several name brands, many of which received glowing reviews, but none excited me in the least. I found many to be very weak, despite the claims of their manufacturers. Many were even downright bitter. Well, I happened to be in a discussion one evening while out for dinner and the subject of  green tea was brought up, followed by the name 'Bigelow'. I obviously had heard the name, but had never tried that particular brand and I was all ears. A number of people at the table drank it regularly. For me, as I stated previously, all the others were either weak (with very little taste), or they had a very bitter aftertaste with a almost 'dry mouth' type of effect. Enter Bigelow green tea. I ordered it here on Amazon. As soon as it arrived, I was ready to try a cup. I followed the directions perfectly when making my first cup and I was extremely happy to find a very substantial and pleasing taste with no bitterness what-so-ever. Even when I accidentally left the tea bag in the cup a bit too long, there were no adverse results. I still had a great cup of green tea. Most directions will tell you to 'not squeeze the bag', but I even tried this just to see what difference, if any, it would cause. What I found was a cup of tea that was still very pleasing in taste, just a bit stronger. Still, there was no bitterness. In conclusion, Bigelow is so very good, that it would take something very extraordinary to have myself even think of making a change. I now sit down to my evening tea, knowing the enjoyment that awaits. I truly think you'll love this tea. As to packaging, the tea-bags are packaged four to a pouch. Carefully open the foil pouch with a scissor at one end, remove a tea-bag and fold the edge of the pouch over to keep the unused tea-bags fresh. There really is no need for each tea-bag to have a separate pouch.","05 17, 2014",A3JTNHAZHUMWY3,"D. F. Terranova ""abephroeman""",It must be Bigelow for me!!,1400284800

I originally started using NuNaturals Stevia Powder but realized that their product, while better than commercial brands, still needed some changes. I did not want a stevia product that had maltodextrin as a filler as I feel it's unnecessary and problematic. I love SweetLeaf Stevia Powder because it has only vegetable inulin (prebiotic) which is MUCH healthier. However, I had a problem mixing it in cold beverages because it would settle to the bottom in clumps. I bought this dropper bottle at a health food store and decided to give it a try. A great thing about Sweet Drops is that the company does not use glycerine as an emulsifier like NuNaturals Liquid Stevia. Plus, they don't use alcohol (which I cannot use because I cannot digest it). I am very happy with this product as it mixes with no problems. I don't even have to use a spoon because I can just gently stir the beverage by moving it in a horizontal circle with my hand. The only downside is that this product is not purse-friendly since it must be refrigerated upon opening. But, I use it for my beverages at home and save the packets for when I have beverages outside the home.","03 16, 2014",ANL4FGMVWPQ6K,MissLeopard83,Best quality stevia available!,1394928000

Of the six flavors we sampled, these were the weakest.I didn't care for the smell of the buffalo wing flavor, and my husband, who loves buffalo wings, said it barely tastes like them.  It's more like a spicy salt. The kettle corn barely has any flavor unless you dump a lot on; since the kettle corn popcorns are pretty good, this is needless extra sodium. Of these three, the Ranch was the best but it also has the most calories - and it still takes a lot to bring the flavor across. Using Hidden Valley powdered ranch would give better results with only a little more calories. Unlike the cheese flavored seasonings, these really don't have much use beyond popcorn (well, maybe the ranch if it weren't so weak).Overall, these flavors were just not worth purchasing for me.

There&#8217;s no good way to hold your fingers over the lid to keep the seasoning from coming out.The Kettle Corn was my favorite flavor.

This seasoning was quite bland.

While I'm not over the moon about any of them, they do provide a variety of options for flavoring popcorn, even if these in particular do not come near the taste of what we think of as caramel or kettle corn.

I'm not kidding, just thinking about it makes my mouth and tongue burn, but in a good way.  Tasting fresh, relatively thin in consistency, our only complaint is that the jar is difficult to open.  Without ourOXO Good Grips Jar Opener, I don't know that I would have been able to pop the top.  The batch we received has a best by date of more than a year, but it was difficult to find and read on the top edge of the glass jar.  I also think it's worth mentioning that despite the labeling of ""Gluten free,"" there is a teeny tiny print warning that this is, ""Made in a facility that uses milk, wheat, soy, egg, fish, peanuts, tree nuts, and crustaceans.""  So, if you're a celiac or allergic to any of the above, be forewarned by this consumer.The ingredient list is interesting in that the peppers are solely jalape&ntilde;o, and judging from the heat of the salsa, they don't skimp on the peppers.  Using an Aztec style of flame roasting the vegetables, the flavors are well married and produced a great salsa for cooking as well as dipping.  We've become hooked on this and it's been enjoyed by each person who's tasted it with the exception of a single lightweight.  It's interesting to me that sesame oil is used with no other oils, and I wonder if it is used in the fire roasting process or added to the salsa.  I'd guess that the it's in the roasting and not added to the mix.  Any way it's done, this is a tasty salsa, but the heat definitely overpowers any separation of flavors.

As soon as it arrived I decided oatmeal was what's for dinner.  However, I was somewhat disappointed in the final product.  This is definitely fast and easy and would be perfect for a cold morning in a hurry.  Just put a package of oatmeal and a package of add-ins in your favorite mug.  Use the Keurig cup to add flavor and sugar and 6 ounces of water and in less than a minute you have a nice breakfast.  So what was I disappointed in?  First and foremost is that this was 310 calories!  That seemed like a lot for a small mug of oatmeal and I suspect that a lot of that is the sugar.  I would greatly prefer this in a sugar free version but I might not need the Keurig cup then, just the Keurig hot water????  It is good but not 310 calories good.  Second, I was let down by the lack of flavor.  It sort of tasted like apple and the nuts were there but did not add any flavor and there might have been a hint of cinnamon but all in all I found it lacking in flavor.  Even to lovely, comforting flavor of oatmeal did not come through very much. Third, I comes in a HUGE box -- way bigger than I think it needs to be.  The box is 10 X 8 X 7 (inches).  It takes up much more room than I am willing to dedicate in my cabinet or pantry.  The box is not nearly full and the various parts (you need three things to make each serving) could be packaged carefully and take up much less room.  Perhaps the manufacturer wanted to see if this would be successful before investing in expensive packaging equipment?  Don't know, but I don't want this big box jamming up my cabinets.So this product is not bad.  I really like the idea but they could have done so much better with the execution.  Add more intense flavors, cut the calories and cut the packaging and it would be good.  Until then, I think I will pass.","04 21, 2014",A29NV2YITU0EJK,"Jo Ann Graham ""joanng417""",It's OK,1398038400

I hadn't tried anything like that until a couple of summers ago when I tried something similar at Cabot farms in Vermont.  Of course everyone went wild over it.This Kernel Season's Ranch Seasoning is an awesome way to liven up popcorn or veggies.  Even salads for that matter, but I wanted to try some out to liven up some of the foods I eat.  None of the ingredients are out of line and that I totally appreciate.The flavor is tangy with that just right ranch flavor.  I do like certain popcorns because they have a wow flavor I'm looking for, but the Kernel Season's are a welcome addition.

We tasted the tuna and immediately remarked that it had a mild, pleasant taste which we liked very much.This can will serve two people and has 70 calories per serving.

The salt content is slight, only 6% of our daily requirement.We both agreed that this is a delicious tuna which we will buy again.  Highly recommended.Update: The two negative votes puzzle me.

Actually, people who truly prefer dark chocolate mind find these too sweet.  And they DO actually contain milk (quite a bit, judging by the prominence of milk and milk products in the ingredient list), so are they really ""dark chocolate""?

To be honest, this was out of ignorance, just assuming that Grade A meant the best quality. The rating system in Canada is different, and it also had a lot to do with color and flavor in those rating letters.I did a head to head taste test with some Ohio Grade A maple syrup that I got at Whole Foods, and this on some fresh Trader Joe's buttermilk pancakes. The difference was clear.The grade A syrup was sweet, more along the lines of taste of a white cane sugar, with the complexity of something like cotton candy. Light, simple. This product has the complexity and sweetness of something like fresh homemade root beer. It has a more earthy complexity, though not aggressive or overwhelming/bitter like you can sometimes experience with molasses, but very interesting and enjoyable.I didn't notice that one syrup was more or less sweet than the other-- the difference was in the taste and color.  If you like the roasted tones in caramel or the complexity of rootbeer (or a nice dark porter) I think you would enjoy this syrup.One of my favorite icings for cinnamon rolls calls for maple syrup as an ingredient, and I can't wait to try this to see how it enhances the flavor!I was surprised to find all of the different uses for maple syrup. I often try to avoid sugar, but do occasionally make fresh iced tea at home. Realizing that this contains a lot of vitamins and minerals, it would be interesting to try this. At least I'd be getting something beneficial as compared to regular sugar!By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon.

I added 2 more spoons, but instead of tasting like coconut water, it tasted more like what I imagine semen/jizz/cum tastes like. Bleh. Also, they add salt to this, and I could taste it on my lips, as if I had a drink with salt on the rim.Of course, the purpose of this stuff is to give you the electrolytes that are in coconut water, and I suppose they accomplish that task.

We made a 16 ounce bottle of Coco Hydro as instructed, and I opened a bottle of real coconut water, and marked the cups. We both took turns, and immediately knew which was which. The real coconut water was so rich and flavorful, it wasn't really a contest. The Coco Hydro was weak and cummy tasting, salty.

Unfortunately the vivid green powder can  turn a fruit smoothie muddy, but I don't worry too much about the color unless I'm making something to serve to other people.  And for green smoothies it's perfect.  It adds a slightly different green note than kale or spinach, and enlivens the drink.When you purchase matcha from Kiss Me Organics, you can download a PDF cookbook with a lot of different recipes.  This goes well beyond the standard smoothies.  You'll find recipes for things like matcha brownies, matcha truffles, and even savory dishes like tuna burgers and duck breast.  I can't say that I've gone much beyond the drink stage -- this morning I made a green tea frappucino and it was delicious! -- but I think many of the recipes are worth considering.  One thing I'll say is that the photos may be a bit misleading.  In my experience and as I wrote above, things like smoothies tend to take on a strange brownish color when matcha is added.The one problem I have here is that I think the cost is a bit high.  In a perfect world I'd take off half a star for the price, but as I can't I'm going to err on the side of my taste buds (and more efficient brain, thank you very much) and give it the full five stars.

Even though one might think this seasoning could be mostly used on top of popcorn, it can also be used on potatoes, pasta, rice and much, much more.  I decided to do my taste test on white rice.I used boil-in-a-bag long grain white rice.  I did add regular butter and salt to my rice, so I want to make sure that was clarified here.  However, the rice didn't taste &#34;buttery&#34; with just the butter.  In case I didn't like it, I only shook some on a small area of my rice.  The product was absorbed by the moisture of the rice.  (I also wanted some rice that didn't have it so I could compare &#34;with&#34; and &#34;without&#34; the seasoning.)  As I stated above, I was wrong about any chalky or powdery flavor.

I generally avoid gluten, but I ate this with no problem and that is generally what I go by.

There is black tea in this product, but no strong tea flavor.Although the serving size is 3/4 teaspoon per 8 oz. glass, I would definitely use LESS, as it's quite strongly flavored.  SO, instead of 24 servings per bottle, you will likely get about 32.

Using this in bottles of water is sensible.

Most of the gluten-free pasta I buy is either corn-based or made with brown rice. Corn pasta often cooks up chewy and starchy, and when it cools off it becomes hard, so leftovers can be a bit rubbery or even crunchy unless they're simmered in liquid on the stovetop. Brown rice pasta is much softer, so soft it can fall apart easily even in the boil, and reheating often makes it mush.I don't know what they did with the Barilla pasta, but it was done right. We made a delicious mac n cheese from scratch, and the noodles held up even after reheating, though they had a slight chewiness that you won't find in semolina pasta that's cooked al dente, but for gluten-free pasta that's quite an accomplishment.

It is quite hard to explain the taste, you just have to try it foryourself, but it is a flavor explosion of different seasonings all combined together into one terrific mix that is as compatiblewith mango and pineapple juice as it is Jack Daniels.Dale's can be used on other meats besides beef, but honestly, we have never tried it. I love it & if we buy it, we are buyingsteaks too! The only negative thing I can say about it is that I about died when I read how much sodium is in it, but no fear,they now have a reduced sodium version which tastes exactly the same to me! The only problem is, not all stores carry thereduced sodium version!We love to cook out all the time & when we can, like to entertain friends and family & there has not been one time thatsomeone hasn't repeatedly praised the steak after we used this. It makes for a nice flavoring for steak/chicken kabobs too.Soak the steak & chicken in it for awhile then assemble kabobs, brushing some over the veggies also & it is an awesomemeal!If you love steak & love cooking at home, then you absolutely must try this, you will not regret it!","02 10, 2014",A3D6OI36USYOU1,Ghenghis,Its a Southern thing.,1391990400

This is not a complaint...I like a little heat.Perhaps it's this extra heat that causes the cilantro taste to get lost.  I see pieces of cilantro in the salsa, but I don't taste it.  Cilantro is so good when it's fresh...you're probably better off adding a bit of chopped fresh cilantro directly to the salsa when you serve it (this is a nice tip for any salsa though).The garlic taste stands out, in a good way.  That is, it is noticeable without being overpowering (you will probably notice the heat more than the garlic).All in all, good salsa.  I'd buy it again.

It's definitely pure extract with no fillers added. (Nothing but vanilla and alcohol.) And it's strong. I've been able to cut down on the amount suggested in most recipes and still have great vanilla flavor. Plus, I like the taste. It does have a somewhat different taste from most brands of vanilla.

Most canned tuna is albacore, as is this one, but you can also get yellow fin tuna which tastes quite different (better IMHO).  There's quite a variation in canned albacore though.  There's light tuna, solid tuna, etc.  This says &#34;solid&#34; and it's the most solid I've had--meaning that it's basically one solid piece of tuna which almost completely fills the can--which is great.  That's not always the case, and frequently light or non-solid tuna cans contain a bunch of pieces or the tuna falls apart easily.  Not the case here--indeed, you need to put a fork in it to get it out of the can!  It has a nice pull-tab so you don't need a can opener (great if your hiking around for example).  Some cans have water and some have oil.  This variety has olive oil (a good choice which goes well with the tuna--and, if you stir fry like me, you can use the oil in the pan).  The taste of albacore is generally pretty mild, this one IMHO is perhaps a bit tastier than some others.It's nice that they give 13 cents to World Wildlife Fund--it's one of my favorite charities and I donate to them annually anyway.  I've seen the WWF signs in other countries during my foreign travels.  Wild Selections has other varieties such as mentioned above (e.g. light tuna, water based).  This particular variety (solid tuna in oil) is a bit more expensive than some of their other varieties (solid usually costs more in any brand) and is a bit more expensive than some other brands as well--which is the only downside I can see for this product.

You can't really put any pressure on it at all, to dip it in something, or to spread something on it. And I don't really like the taste. I will use them still for a healthy base for something when I need a snack since I bought so many, but I think food should be enjoyable. I like the Sesame ones a bit better, at least, because I like Sesame seeds.In the meantime while I try to use these up, I must say I was very excited to find a substitute that is cheaper, healthy, and crunchy - someone recommended using fresh cucumbers sliced at an angle for salsa and a number of other toppings, both salty and sweet. I'm not that into cucumbers, but I'm not against them either, and they do have good anti-inflammatory properties (particularly if they are organic, or at least well-washed and at least partially peeled). I was amazed that it is actually really refreshing and tasty, as well as guilt-free and crunchy! Unless you need a hot food, like you want to melt some cheese on it or something, I have found that the cucumber is far superior to this cracker in nearly every way! Sometimes I don't want so much water content, but I find often that is just when my body is too low on salt so adding some to what I'm eating works fine even if it's on a cucumber. If I still just need something dry to snack on, air-popped popcorn is a lot cheaper and easier to flavor than these crackers.They're not terrible as a product, and I like that they're all-natural, but I personally don't like the taste, and thus the price is especially not worth it.","01 9, 2014",AVM45CGFXTYTG,TropicalFish,Sigh,1389225600

Rather than wasting time and money to send them back, I decided to find ways to incorporate them into our meal plans.First I made a batch of granola with nothing but steel-cut oats instead of rolled oats. Results = way too crunchy and dense for our liking. The next batch was half rolled oats and half steel-cut; much better but still too crunch and too many little bits in the bottom of the cereal bowl. The third batch was 5 parts rolled to 1 part steel-cut (recipe calls for six cups). Perfect! We love the additional crunch that these add, especially since I recently seem to be having trouble with eating nuts.Second, I decided to try grinding these in the dry-grains blender of my Vitamix to make oat flour. Voila! Believe it or not, these made a much finer flour than the rolled oats, probably because the dry-grains blade works better on harder items rather than soft. The oat flour was very smooth and consistent, and tasted great in the baked goods, too.I probably won't buy a four-pack of steel-cut oats again for awhile, but when I do order more, I'll be happy to get them from Bob's Red Mill since the quality is always good.","01 28, 2014",A3A56XDU9H2WUQ,AlisonA,Oops...,1390867200

This review is based on using this product for Topping rather than Popping.My husband and kids go crazy over popcorn, especially over movie theater popcorn.  My husband puts way too much butter on in my opinion though.  I would never dream of using half of what he uses.  So, the same happened with this, he wanted to put a ton on.  I'd already put what I thought was a decent amount but he went an added more to his.  He loved it.  He said he thought it would've  pretty similar to movie theater popcorn if I'd allowed him to use all that he wanted.  To me, since I only used what I considered a decent amount, it didn't do a lot for me.  I didn't think it had a very buttery taste.  My daughter even melted some additional butter to put on hers.  My son enjoyed it just how I made it.So, we all 4 had varying thoughts about this product.  Had I used way more than I did, I probably would've liked it just fine but I refuse to add that many calories.  If you are someone that could care less how much you use or the amount of calories that you are eating them I'm sure you'll like this just fine.  If you are someone like me who only want the labeled serving size then it may not be enough flavor to make you like it.  I add popcorn seasonings on mine to give it additional flavor so I'm all right with the taste one I add the seasonings.I would recommend trying this, just know that it takes a good amount to make it taste like you probably want it to taste.  3 1/2 stars based on the mixed feelings in my house.","06 1, 2014",A1ITRGMT80D5TK,"ThisThatNEverything ""thisthatneverything""","Pretty Decent, Takes a Lot for Topping, Mixed Review, 3 1/2 Stars",1401580800

However, some people are sensitive to it, or become sensitive, or becomes part of the problem.  *sad face*For me, for a few reasons, I needed to cut back. Thought that wouldn't be a problem, except that in recent years, I had actually learned to enjoy the taste of *good coffee*, and would actually miss the taste and ritual of making a cup-- even with other fine substitutions that I use (dandelion coffee and other alternatives are very good-- but they are really only that- alternatives).So, I was accidentally given a box of Newmans Own decaf, which sat unopened for a year. I recently decided to try it. Having had their original (good, but a little light for my taste), I thought maybe it would be an adequate substitution. I was wrong, it really tasted more like water than coffee. On the plus, I found it works well as a carrier for an evening cup of coffee and Irish Cream. My next foray into decaf was when I tried a sip of Donut House, and was pleasantly surprised that it had a regular coffee smell with a stronger (yet still inadequate) coffee flavor over the Newmans Own. I would buy Donut House again as it is at least readily available at local stores.Since I am a great fan of Dark Magic extra bold k-cups, and have preferred them time and time again over several dozen other brands of Kcups, I decided to check out the reviews for their decaff offering between here, the company website, and the Keurig website. When I saw reviews that stated that they loved the regular, and thought the decaff tasted like the regular, I had to order a box immediately.I drink 1/2 to one Dark Magic regular cup of coffee most mornings. However, if I find am not sleeping as well, or blood pressure is going up, or just don't feel the desire for caffeine (over taxed adrenals?), yet I still want a cup of coffee, a good cup of decaff does the job. I found that good cup in &#34;Dark Magic Extra Bold Decaf&#34;; it really does taste amazingly like their caffeinated counterpart. Nothing about it tastes like &#34;brown water&#34;.  It tastes like regular coffee. But you have to like bold, biting coffee.Seriously, it tastes so much like regular coffee that I really did go back to the box, and the cups to make sure it said decaf.I will be ordering this brand again. And again..","02 21, 2014",A3SJWDPZASTU17,C. Marquis,Tastes so much like their regular coffee I had to look at the box again to make sure it is decaf.,1392940800

I went looking for the whole wheat Hodgson Mill lasagna noodles I usually buy and my supermarket was all out of them.  I prefer whole grain pastas and I saw these from Tinkyada, so I bought them instead.  I've had good luck with Tinkyada pastas in the past, so I figured I would be happy with these.These are pretty good lasagna noodles.  They're the kind you have to cook (by boiling) on the stovetop first, but I prefer that kind.  (Some of the no-boil ones get too crunchy for my taste.)  They didn't stick together during cooking; the water from cooking was slightly discolored, but that seems common to Tinkyada pastas and doesn't affect the taste at all.I followed the directions on the box and boiled these for slightly less than the stated cooking time, since I planned to put them in the oven afterwards.  If I had it to do over again, I would probably boil them for a minute or two longer, as they were a little tough.  (Also, I know that other Tinkyada brown rice pastas stand up well to overcooking.)  However, despite the toughness, I was pleased with the result.  I thought the taste was very good, as well, and they were not too ""rustic"" as whole grain pastas tend to be.  The lasagna made with them has also been very good as leftovers.A few of these did rip apart just a little after cooking.  This was about the same as what I've experienced with other brands of lasagna noodles, though.If you're going to use these in lasagna, make sure the top is covered with cheese and sauce, or the top layer of noodles will dry out a little bit.Overall, I'm pleased with these and would definitely consider buying them again.

I was thinking my Keurig brewer had seen it's better days and needed to be replaced soon.Then came Christmas and I ordered a few new coffees I wanted to try and much to my shock, when loaded with new std plastic k-cups, the machine brewed faster than I've ever seen.What happened? - Fog Chasers have a unique cloth/mesh bottom and the brewed coffee isn't forced out of the bottom pierced hole when the handle is pushed down to brew. This results in more of a drip effect which aside from being slow, has coffee spraying out causing a mess instead of creating a steady stream!So as much as I like the taste, I've given up Fog Chaser because I can't deal with the slow brewing speed and spraying mess.

Not quite as good as some of the Green Mountain medium roasts, but still perfectly acceptable.French Roast Dark Roast-2-Noticeably weaker than Tully&#8217;s French Roast, which is very strong and smoky, but to be fair Tully&#8217;s FR is extra bold, and this is not.Hazelnut-3-My wife is a hazelnut coffee connoisseur.

I prefer brewing my own tea at home, but making tea away from home is not always easy. With Cold Brew, it got a bit easier.If you like black tea, Lipton Cold Brew is pretty much standard. I also drink Twinings Cold Brew and like it a lot but I feel the company packages it along side other teas and it will often have an Earl Grey flavor which I dislike. With Lipton, the taste is always the same.The smaller individual bags of the Lipton don't leak. With the family size bags of Cold Brew, you get a lot of leakage of leaf flakes if you are not careful with the bags.The cost of the Lipton Cold Brew is much cheaper than Twinings.Twinings' bags are individually wrapped. Lipton bags are not. If you travel with the Lipton, you need to carry them in a baggie or small box.The one thing that really bugs me about the Lipton Cold Brew is the powder residue. Lipton grounds the black tea so fine that is leaves a powdered residue, even dry. The dry residue isn't too bad because it usually remains contained in the box or whatever container I use. However, if you don't remove the bag from the water soon after you make the tea, you get all this stuff floating in the bottom of the glass and it looks yukky.Overall, great tasting tea especially for traveling.

B00FPGL6S4,Grocery,"[0, 0]",4,"If you are used to eating mass-market milk chocolates and want to slowly make your way towards dark chocolate because of the health benefits, this may be a good stepping stone. These 70% cocoa manufactured in New Hampshire chocolates have a more creamy texture to them, something you don't usually find in high percentage dark chocolates.If you are already a dark chocolate aficionado, then you may not like this - unless you want to try it as a curiosity.In the past, this was a more classic dark chocolate. Lindt changed the formula, but they made the mistake of 1) not giving it a different name  2) not explaining it on the box. They should have 1) kept the original formula for loyal fans of the original, 2) created a new line of ""Smooth Dark Chocolate"" or ""Creamy Dark Chocolate"" or ""Dark Chocolate for Dummies"" line for this formula. This would have kept fans of the previous recipe happy and attracted dark chocolate ""beginners"" to the new creamy version.The list of ingredients is nowhere near as long as mass market commercial chocolates. You get: chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, soya lecithin (emulsifier), bourbon vanilla beans. That's all. There are ten squares in a thin wrapper. The box recommends 4 squares as the serving size, but you can obviously eat as few or as many as you like. Four squares are 250 calories with 19g fat (12g sat, 0g trans), 0mg cholesterol, 10mg sodium (0%), 17g carbs (3g fiber, 12g sugars), 3g protein, and single figures of iron and Calcium. Recommended temperature is 60 to 68 degrees (F) and dry - per the packaging.Price wise, if you are planning to eat small portions (eg one square a day), this is competitive versus mass market chocolates since their list of ingredients is longer and more offensive from a dietary perspective than the Lindt.I liked the taste of this, but I am not a dark chocolate purist.  I am not picky on chocolate, my main problem with chocolate is the calories. The 70% dark is certainly a higher percentage than what most mass-market chocolates have (most of them are milk chocolates). Given all that, a single rating can't capture all the caveats, but since a rating must be given, I am giving a rating on the product as it is right now.","05 3, 2014",AYNAH993VDECT,bsg2004,Dark Chocolate for Milk Chocolate Fans,1399075200

After 5 minutes I observed that the water was a light yellow (not bright yellow or orangey, which indicates a dyed imitation).  I removed the strands and saw that they were still red (fake saffron will turn a light color, since it was dyed to look red).  Finally, I added some stevia and drank the ""tea"" - it had a distinctive grassy flavor and aroma with a slight bitter undertone.

That means that the stevia extract - the SECONDARY ingredient in this product - contains at least 95% steviol glycoside.  That DOES NOT MEAN that 95% of this jar contains stevia and the rest is erythritol ... FAR FROM IT.  The label on this sweetener is deliberately written to mislead the reader - if the actual percentages of erythritol and stevia were openly disclosed to consumers, they wouldn't sell much.Yes, erythritol does in fact occur naturally in many fruits, but it occurs there in such microscopically small amounts, that it's completely impractical to obtain it from any ""natural"" sources. Instead, erythritol is manufactured by chemically converting GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN into food-grade starch which is fermented to create glucose, and then processed further to create erythritol. Sound natural to you?  Cargill, the makers of Truvia, recently settled a class-action lawsuit about this very thing - misleading consumers by calling their product (that's mostly erythritol) ""natural.""And contrary to what others have said in reviews or 'answered questions' here about this sweetener, BRAZIL DOES GROW GMO crops - corn, soybeans, and others - and has for years - but that's COMPLETELY BESIDE THE POINT.  The ingredient in this sweetener that was derived from GMOs is the erythritol, NOT the Brazilian stevia. This product is manufactured right here in the U.S. using stevia leaves imported from Brazil, and erythritol added as a cheap filler.Looking for pure, non-GMO, certified organic stevia and nothing else? - then consider thisBetterStevia Powder Organic Now Foods 4 oz Powder.

So cooking the tuna seems a bit of a waste.But I have to admit I like this cooked tuna. It comes in a chunk or steak, not in bits and pieces like is often the case with canned tuna. So it's not as easy to mix with mayonnaise as some other brands. But it has a nice texture, almost like meat instead of fish.And the odor and taste, though fishy and somewhat stronger than most canned tuna, somehow seemed to add to its appeal on the palate rather than detract. You get something with taste and texture rather than a bland blob of something tasting like mayonnaise sitting on your bread.The can we had was white tuna packed in olive oil. The oil seemed to add to the taste, rather than mask it. I think I prefer the oil over water.The can does seem pricey, at close to $4 per can. But you do indeed get what you pay for.

The heel cup is of typical D width dimensions though it tends to tighten around the top of the heel cup which I suspect has prompted the comments about the pressure on the Achille's area.

Everything is padded, so I don't wind up feeling like my circulation is being cut off, nor do I take it off and have bra strap impressions on my shoulders.For three smaller hooks, I was impressed with how well the elastic seems to hold up.  I also think the cups look natural and hold the breasts in a natural, but perky enough position.  Other than the stupid bow (why must they put bows on bras), the material isn't clingy and doesn't pull on fabric or crinkle it.The only thing I wish was different is that the under &#34;wire&#34; portion was thicker.  The size fits me well, but because the under-band makes this weird little curve upwards on your ribcage, it sacrifices support in that area- so the bra sometimes ends up leaving a gap in the bottom middle of my breasts that I find unsupportive and uncomfortable.

And the reviews said to order a size up but, since this only comes in odd sizes, that meant ordering a 9 but the page said a 9 is a 29 inch waist--far too big.Not so.

B00E1O2Q9Y,Clothing,"[1, 1]",3,"First Impressions:* This is a decent looking piece of luggage that rolls on inline wheels.*  Its pull-up/push/down handle rises and lowers easily, locking into just one height.  (At 5' 4"" I find it comfortable for me.) Those with larger hands will like the T-bar handle, as it's comfortably large enough to grasp.  The handle's frame is located on the outside of the bag, leaving it with bulges and an uneven surface (not a negative, just an observation).*  It has a very convenient zip pocket at the top.  It could hold travel documents for easy access, a bottle of water, your e-reader, too.* Outer zip pockets make it possible to access the inside of the suitcase without having to completely unzip it in half.* There are handles on all four sides, making it easy to lift/store.* Being black and without distinct colors/marks leaves this suitcase virtually indistinguishable from others.  It will be important to add a unique address tag to quickly identify it as yours.  (This review also applies to the 'Carbon Full Cycle Twill' bags.  In this instance, the bags have a soft-gray fabric look with red top stitching.)Upon Further Inspection:* This suitcase is made with a sturdy frame.* Its outer `skin' is comprised of a durable-looking nylon and inner compartment's lining is a plastic-feeling material, with mesh pockets.  (My thoughts are that the lining will eventually dry out and crack.)* This bag is well designed.  The mesh should be able to prevent the slipping and wrinkles that occur in a case that isn't fully packed.  These inner compartments also make it easier to find items without digging through the entire bag.* The outer ridges (for the T-handle) on the bag are also two big bumps within the suitcase.  If you want a completely flat inner surface, this will not give it to you.* The places where the wheels are connected to the handle's axle are joined by (surprisingly) sloppy looking plastic caulking.* If you are packing the bag on a bed, it will not roll.  However, if you are using a bench or other smooth surface, it will roll, as the inline skates cannot be tipped to the side.  If using a fold-out luggage rack with straps, it should be fine, provided the wheels can hang over the side of the rack.* The zippers on this luggage appear to be durable, but do not smoothly move along their tracks.  (You may want to rub wax candle on one of the tracks to see if it improves the glide.)Last Thoughts:* This is a mid-range price point for a piece of luggage.  Its durability remains to be seen.*  Infrequent travelers may want to select a less expensive bag, while those who travel frequently may opt for a suitcase with these features:  360-degree wheels, better quality lining, handles with two adjustable heights, piggy-backing capability (a strap allows you to attach multiple bags together, but lets you wheel just one).* While this is proclaimed to be a light-weight bag, note that if weight issues are a concern, there are lighter bags on the market.","06 25, 2014",A7YMD8MSOBO1I,Sharon Beverly,Has Its Good and Less Desirable Features,1403654400

I carefully examined them and was impressed with what I found (especially when I only paid about forty-five bucks!)The zippers are sturdy. I compared them to the ones on the boots these replaced and they were about the same quality. Considering that the ones being replaced were three years old and the zippers were still as good as when I first purchased them, I have a lot more confidence in these. And I will admit that I was a little suspicious of the low price of these. Not to worry on that count.Other reasons why I gave these five stars are the fit (a little tight on width at first, but they wore in quickly. The no-slip sections or the soles and heels are beautifully matched to the leather (or whatever that material is). Plus the heel material is nailed in as well as bonded. Both the insole and seat fit my heel perfectly, and the outer material looks and smells like leather.Time will tell with respect to how long these will last, but as of now I am not only thrilled with the purchase, but still in disbelief that I got them for such a low price.

These flexibles are my new best friend! They are the first tops I've had that have a cute feminine look, are comfortable, move with me, don't ride up when I sit down, smoothly cover my large bust without either looking like I'm wearing a tent or so tight that I feel I look unprofessional. Nothing worse than a top that's too tight or shows cleavage when you're working with pediatrics or geriatric men!! The side panels colors blend in with the material and are soft and smooth making the top feel a lot more like a regular shirt than a scrub. The sleeves are a good size & cut they don't limit your reach like other scrubs do. The only thing I don't love about this style is the little clip buttons on the pockets-- I don't think shirt pockets need to close and the little flap gets in the way of pulling things in and out of your pockets quickly. Also the length could stand to be a little longer but I'm 5'11&#34; so I expect the regular sizes to hit me about an inch shy of where I'd prefer, fortunately this top is stretchy so it can be pulled down slightly for added length.

The motion is beautiful, and the sweeping second hand definitely keeps things classy.I really like the curve of the face, and it fits quite well even on larger wrists. I did have a link removed, but I prefer my watches a bit loose on the wrist.One thing to keep in mind with this one though, while the clasp is a brilliant design, the Bulova logo will take some abuse if you're at a desk quite a bit in a day.The other issue is the fault of the nice curved crystal... it can get abraded fairly easily. The crystal is quite durable, but it's also not protected at all. I have bezeled watches that I will wear if I know I'll have a rough day, but there are times I forget and this thing takes a beating. It's holding up well, but there are some surface scratches that wouldn't be there if the face were protected a bit more.All in all, I would buy another and I would pay more than this to get it. I wear it damn near every day, and have gotten a lot of compliments on it. It's definitely a nicer watch than most, but without the usual pitfalls of something else this price.

B0091EIZKS,Clothing,"[1, 1]",4,"Bought this tee to take on vacation to a country where modest dress is sometimes a requirement.  Ended up wearing it with capri-length pants on a very, very hot day spending a lot of time hiking around outside, and I'm very happy with the way the shirt performed.  The fabric on it is thick; you will not see the outline of a bra through it, and there's no worry of it being sheer (at least not in the avocado color).  The avocado color itself is a pretty light green; not neon-bright, but not boring either. The neckline is pretty much t-shirt high, but there's the little v that gives the neck a little breathing room, which is really nice without being revealing.  The sleeves are standard t-shirt length; longer than a cap sleeve, shorter than a man's t-shirt.  They completely cover the shoulder and the top of the arm.  I'd say the sizing runs a little big; I normally wear a medium in t-shirts because I like a little space, but I bought a small in this one and I'm glad I did.  It was plenty long-enough (shorter than tunic length, it's not a shirt I'd pair with leggings, but longer than a standard tee shirt, very close to what's shown on the model) and roomier than any small I've ever really worn, although it did still maintain a nice shape.Being the fabric was so thick, I was worried I'd overheat, but I had no choice but to give it a shot. And surprisingly, I was no hotter than I'd have been in most of my tank tops.  The fabric breathed really well, didn't show sweat too glaringly, and generally was great.  I was comfortable all day, as comfortable as one can be in extreme heat and humidity anyway.  I'm not sure it'll become a wardrobe staple, since it's a little older-looking than I normally tend to go, but I'm going to try to find a way to fit it into heavier rotation, since it's so comfortable.

I have always wanted a pair of thigh high slouchy boots, but they are usually outrageously priced in stores and on certain websites. I fell in love with the picture and desctription and especially, the price. After reading other customer reviews, I had mixed feelings. A lot of reviewers loved them, but there were quite a few that made mention of the boots being cheaply made. Because of the price, I took a chance and ordered them anyways. They arrived within a few days, and when I pulled them out of the box, I was not disappointed. The boots are absolutely adorable. I had a little issue getting them on, because there is no zipper, but they fit well. Be warned, they run small. I usually wear a 9 or a 10, depending on how they are made, but I ordered an 11 just in case. Im glad I did. These boots wouldn't have fit me if I hadnt ordered a size up. They are by far the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I took away one star, because the boots do feel a little cheaply made, and I honestly don't expect more than a few months of wear out of them. The souls are thin, and the inside material of the boots feels like nothing more than some kind of cheap foamy material. But for the price, you honestly cant beat them. They look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans ( I have worn them with both). I will most likely order another pair, just in case and maybe in another color. I'm glad I ordered them, and I have already recommended them to friends.","01 10, 2014",ATIM2RX9OG4AT,natasha gibbs,Adorable...but....,1389312000

I have a huge running shoe collection because my body is apparently very picky with shoes. Who knew.Firstly this shoe is ugly in the gray/teal. It looks like something my grandmother would wear. When you put it on it is immediately apparent that this is a LOT of shoe. It feels &#34;big&#34; and not size wise - rather it just feels kind of clunky. It's not heavy - in fact it is very light, but the way it is designed it comes up very high all around and so it makes it feel less like a running shoe and more like a work shoe. It is more similar to my hiking shoes than to my running shoes. I've had several people remark how not attractive it is - so I always have this &#34;yeah I'll wear it but it's so ugly feeling&#34; which doesn't work well for me. Now I don't go for only attractive shoes - but I just find these so unattractive it's hard not to think about what I've got on my feet. Yes I'm a little shallow - but these really are on the other side of ugly.As for comfort and running these are great. They are very comfortable and very supportive. You can absolutely feel the cushion - no way to mistake it. They do feel somewhat like a Hoka and they have the same issue as Hoka's for me and that is stability. I feel like my feet are not stable in them - like there is too much shift and I'm on top of a platform and could fall off almost. No I do not need stability shoes (I'm a neutral runner with a high arch and no pronation issues). I feel like I'm always conscious of being slightly unstable so it affects my gait. Since they also feel so &#34;much&#34; for my feet this makes me feel like I'm running more carefully and when I should just be able to run freely I keep coming back to how they feel on my feet. They are &#34;always&#34; there - absolutely no disappearing for me.The 3 star rating is a compromise. I use these for recovery runs in my neighborhood - around 3-7 miles. They provide enough cushion so my feet/legs are not tired at all when I'm finished which is perfect for this type of run. However they are just too much shoe (and too ugly) and not quite stable enough to use for any form of racing. Since I run races that are 10K-Half Marathon's these shoes would provide the cushion I need but with the issues I just don't feel comfortable using them.","05 21, 2014",A3TP31S61PPE3G,AlexJouJou,Recovery runs are good - but this is a LOT of shoe (and it's ugly - Boo!),1400630400

I am not knocking the lighter weight model, but these are beefier and, well, actually luxurious against my skin.What I love is the tagless design, which adds to the comfort. The colors are vivid  and stay that way. I usually purchase mine locally and have some of these that have gone through thirty wash cycles and they almost zero fade. Another thing I love is the relatively thick cotton fabric. Compared to the lighter ones I mentioned, these are noticeably heavier, but still breathe on hot, humid days. I wear this model both as an outer shirt, and as an under shirt, and it works well in both scenarios.Stitching, and seams are strong and straight, so the workmanship is solid. Although they are pre-shrunk I recommend ordering the next size up if you are borderline between sizes. Also, after ten or so wash cycles the inside printed label fades to the point that you have to look at the seams to determine if they are right side out or not.

That's a definite plus for me. I'm not fanatical about the subject, but I do prefer to buy domestic items if possible. In my experience, it's very unusual to find any article of clothing or footwear that's not made overseas.""Other than that, these shoes seem very well made of quality materials. They're true to size in both length and width. I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, and this size 7 fits perfectly as long as I wear relatively thick socks. The sides and top easily spread out very wide, so they're exceptionally easy to put on. I'd rate the built-in arch support as medium--not too little, not too much. It's just right for me.""I'm not really wild about the shiny silver finish on much of the material; I can't help but think it won't hold up well over time. The subdued purple and orange accents are subtle and attractive. I would prefer that the sides of the sole be gray rather than stark white, which I think will get dirty and scuffed very quickly, but that's not a big issue. The sole itself is flat and deeply textured, so grip is excellent--although I haven't yet tested them on a wet surface.""These shoes fit me better than any others that I've owned in recent memory. With their pleasing design, excellent materials, perfect fit and sturdy construction, I expect them to provide me with many years of use. If you're looking for a good pair of shoes and want to ""buy American,"" you should definitely consider these.""","07 2, 2014",AOE0XMITAJWDT,Terry Sunday,"Finally, a Pair of Shoes that Fits!",1404259200

I purchased this band (Mens Rubbertech (TM) Silicone Rubber Watchband Stainless Steel Deployment Buckle - by JP Leatherworks) hoping to modify it to fit the Pathfinder watches. I used a Dremel type tool to narrow the watch mount a little and an exacto blade to cut the center out of the band(where it mounts to the watch). It worked perfectly!

B00FI0LTXE,Clothing,"[2, 2]",3,"This item arrived quickly and is definitely a dress that I will look forward to wearing, but I wanted to share a couple heads up pointers for potential buyers. In particular, I found that the fit of this dress tends to run for a very thin, not too busty body frame. I struggled reading the reviews to decide which size would be appropriate for me to buy, and I decided to go with the Small size 4/6 (I am usually like a 3) and it does fit as I would like. One thing I found odd is that the black banding pattern around the waist does not appear as close together as it does in this photo (it is a notable and significant black band clearly distinct from the waist area), and that the white bust portion definitely works better for a slightly flatter chested girl (and I am just a 34 C). I weigh 115 and am 5'5&#34; and it looks like I have a larger stomach by the way these weird black half circle bands stretch above the belly and down almost on top of the butt on the back side. I fixed this issue by taking a blue sash belt and tying it high up under the best to make a bow/floating sash belt, to distract the eye from some of this awkwardness. Overall, a cute dress but if you are even the slightest bit possessing curves or busty it may need some amendments.","01 30, 2014",A3FII5GIF8X4FG,Julie Ann,Cute cocktail dress but a few things to take note of..,1391040000

I've never tried Danskos before.  I have plantar fasciitis so I have to be really careful about what type of shoes I wear.  This is what I found. First of all they are totally cute.  I ordered the 39 (I usually wear an 8 to 8 1/2) and it was fine width-wise and length-wise as well, maybe a bit long but I have really short toes compared to where my arches hit so I'm calling it good) but it hurt the tops of my feet right where the laces start (by the toes)  The shoes have hard bottoms so they don't actually bend like you would expect a tennis shoe to bend.  They sort of &#34;roll.&#34;  They also make a strange sort of &#34;clickety clack&#34; noise on the hard floor which is disconcerting when I'm looking at what appears to be a sneaker. The laces tighten nicely but my heel still slips quite a bit.  I'm not sure how much they will stretch out with wear and if I can get used to the uncomfortable area above the laces. Since they don't actually bend, I'm not sure how much that will affect the comfort.  I will change socks to thicker ones with more cushion and wear them around the house to see if I can get used to them and get the heel to stop slipping.  If I can't, I'll be sending them back.

I usually need a large shirt (e.g. Banana Republic 100% Pima cotton T-shirt) as my shoulders are fairly wide, but I am not a big guy - 5'8&#34; 150#.  I am kind of a big medium or a small large, depending.  Usually, as I said, I buy a large shirt.Cressi is the cheapest.  Don't ask me why but the color configuration is exactly the same as the O'Neill, so I thought they might actually be the same garment, different labels - but I was wrong.  This is 80% polyester, 20% elastane.  It says SPF of 40.  For me, the XL was the one that fit.  Just putting the L over my head I knew it wouldn't fit.  It is the shortest of the three brands, which may be good, as who wants a lot of material bunching up around your hips - but it will probably be too short for taller guys.  The material feels kind of thick and a bit inflexible.  Not super soft.  May last longer though.O'Neill medium priced.  89% polyester, 11% elastane.  This has a softer hand than the Cressi and is longer too.  For me the L was slightly big, but the M was too small.  I would go with the L.  SPF is rated at 50.  The length feels right for the size.  The sewing around the neck (on the inside) feels a bit scratch, not sure how that would play out in actual use.Body Glove.  Slightly more expense.  85% polyester, 15% Spandex.  SPF of 50.  A nice soft hand - the softest of the three.  The length feels appropriate for the size.  I only bought an XL and could wear it just fine.  I would expect an L would be a bit too tight.  My favorite.Body Glove is the brand I am replacing, one that is thicker and heavier than these three, 88% Nylon, 12% Spandex.  It lasted for years of use, but is no longer available in a variety of sizes.

Stopped at the local Farm Supply store and bought these (they were cheaper than here, on Amazon).  Holy cow!  What a difference!These are wider at the toe than any other rubber boot I've worn.  They're normal at the heel and through the arch, but get wider at the toe and it makes a difference.  BIG difference.They give good support on uneven ground.  They're not hiking or mountaineering boots, but they do grip your ankles better than you'd expect.They are pretty much water tight.  I shove the legs of my jeans in boots and having taken one more step into water than I should have, I've learned that my jeans get wet above the boots but stay quite dry inside the boots.  Marvelous things, these boots are.There is a potential downside: they are warm.  That doesn't bother me because I am world famous for cold-feeling toes, but if it's noticeable to me, it may be VERY noticeable to someone else.My toes are warm, they have room inside the boot, they are definitely water-tight.  I've had them for 9 months now and like all the boots I've owned, they've been abused and put away wet.  I've mucked through every kind of domestic animal poo you can think of, from emus to pigs to llamas - and a couple of piles of bear poo, too.

I wasn't a fan of wearing a watch, but I am now.Charging:  To charge this, simply connect it to any USB-powered outlet or computer.  Galaxy 2 offers a complicated dongle and because I'll have to charge it more often, it would become a hassle.Less is more:  I realize that with Galaxy 2 I can take pictures and use it as a speakerphone, but do I need that?  First off, taking a picture with your watch will make you look downright creepy at times and I'm sure with time, more public places will notice and restrict the use of it(like gym.)  While talking through a watch might be handy at some point, do I really need to look like a Power Ranger on a street?Thinner:  Sony is thinner by design and as I've mentioned before, it was important for me to have a swartwatch that resembles a more traditional discreet watch rather than a &#34;look at me I'm a futuristic device watch.&#34;Cheaper:  If you get the right deal, this watch can cost you almost two times less than Galaxy 2 and because I do not eat caviar for breakfast nor own a diamond-studded swimming pool, this is important to me as well.Please note that I am not putting Galaxy 2 down.  I'm a fan of both brands.  I own a Galaxy phone and a tablet, which is why I was so torn, but Sony2 suited my lifestyle better.  Both devices are great and it all depends what you need a smartwatch for that should be the deciding factor.","04 27, 2014",A2PSC7LUNIDEAH,Dmitry Kristal,APRIL UPDATE allows you to change background wallpaper.,1398556800

The large dark brown bait stations our association has placed around the periphery of our buildings are a constant reminder that the rats which invaded even my own home a few years ago survive in this wooded suburban community.  I've purchased the larger stations and our maintenance people keep them filled, so they are thrilled to have had an opportunity to try this one which is substantially smaller and way more attractive.  I placed this box behind my own building (of course) for our trial purposes and because I'd heard from neighbors in the rear of this building that the rats had been seen.  Since the one person had sealed off the access points which allowed one to enter her home, I figured that would be the perfect spot.When this type of rat bait is used, it's not typical to find a rat coming back for more because they leave the station and then they die.  Another rat comes on over and has a taste and the same happens to him/her.  Since this station supposedly can kill 10 rats, unless you have a serious infestation, you will not see the bait disappear overnight.  There is so much to consider when attempting to rid your home or business of vermin, and I suggest not making a hasty decision.  For example, the last thing you'd want, I'm sure, is to have your victims crawl to and die somewhere inside your walls.  The decomposition is nasty if the source of an odorous situation cannot be located or accessed.  So, seal off access points and then go for the kill.  I like this station and look forward to having it emptied.  I've asked the maintenance guys to move it to the next building in a couple weeks if bait remains.","06 27, 2014",A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,JO,"It is bait and when rats eat it, they die where they are, not usually at the station",1403827200

I was a bit skeptical at the ability of an electric grill being able to perform as a propane or charcoal grill could but I have eaten my doubt and words.Product arrives in a big box but is actually rather compact; this is because there is no base for the grill to sit on.  That base cart can be purchased as an accessory.  I have always taken issue with the fact that Weber makes you purchase this cart separately.  For a little bit more they should just include it with your original purchase.I wish that we could have used this grill outside but since we have been dealing with the &#34;POLAR VORTEX&#34; for the last month there has never been a warm or dry enough day to sit on the balcony grilling while dreaming of a NY steamy summer.  We opted to grill inside and I will be the first to warn you against doing this UNLESS you have previously done this and understand that there will be a lot of smoke and you will have the smell of street cart vendor stuck to everything on your body!  We set up an air machine, ceiling fan and opened a few windows on this frigid day (21 degrees) and grilled.  There was the mandatory 20 min pre-heat prep for proper searing and temperature regulation.  This wasn't an issue as I took the time to prepare our meal and prep the pork belly and pork chops.The grill heats up quickly and evenly.  I assumed that the metal dome top would steam everything rather than provide a true sear to anything.  I was extremely surprised when all the chops including the pork belly came out beautifully seared and the fat on the pork belly was perfectly charred to our liking.  It was so QUICK!!  Honestly it was quicker than our infrared propane grill on the balcony that we use during the summer.  You have to keep the lid down and this effectively cooks everything quickly and provides the right amount of heat combined with the awesome grates.A tiny issue is that cooking surface is a bit small.  We had to cook everything in 3 batches.  Again, the grill is super quick!  There were two pork bellies and 2 odd shaped chops that would fit at a time.  If you need a better example: Imagine 6 center cut boneless chops; that is what you can grill at one time on the small surface.  Depending on what we are preparing it is not enough space for a family of five.Clean-up is pretty simple and straight-forward.  The grates soak in the sink and then can be wiped clean with your sponge.  You will not need any scouring pads or harsh barbecue brushes.  The bottom bowl located beneath the heating element that catches all the grease/juices is also simple to clean.  Pop out and wash.  This has been the easiest grill we have ever had to clean.Highly recommend for apartment dwellers that are not allowed because of board rules, landlords or city regulations to have a gas or charcoal grill on their patio, balcony or outdoor space.  This item was made for big cities and any New Yorker would love one.  At first I balked at the price thinking that it would be exactly like a George Foreman, but after trying it out I truly believe that it is worth every penny.  I just wish that they would include the cart.  We simply placed it on top of our washer/dryer.  It was smoky but it is even that way when we grill outside on our balcony.  I would also recommend for the consumer that does not want to deal with charcoal or the constant change of propane tanks.  This is as simple as it can get and your family or guests will most likely not be able to tell the difference.","02 26, 2014",A30Z0GG96D11EO,Wisdom Twin,Q140... electric perfection!,1393372800

My hydrangeas have never gotten beyond 3 feet tall until I started using a deer/rabbit repellent.  The deer always browsed the new growth so the plants looked healthy but no flowers.  Since this is a vacation house, I'm not there to chase off the deer.  We have security cameras so I've seen the footage of the deer going to the bushes & walking away.  I used to have footage of the deer enjoying my bushes.It is rain &#34;resistant&#34; & it did last through a couple rain storms in the two weeks after I applied it  although it had definitely washed off some of it.  I reapplied it just to be sure.  The 30-day claim is perhaps a bit optimistic unless there has been very little or no rain.  You also need to reapply to any new growth because it will not have the nasty flavor on it to deter the deer/rabbits from snacking.It does have an odor until it dries but it is less noticeable than similar products I've used.  It's not very offensive; just a cinnamon/clove scent with the rotten eggs/vinegar.This is an expensive option for deer repellant.  I really don't think it should cost this much considering  the ingredients are not unusual.  Using this with a hose is also kind of messy & maybe more wasteful than other products that don't require a hose.  I think the &#34;concentrate&#34; form would be a better choice.

It&#8217;s amazingly bright, for a solar-powered system.  Anyone who has installed the old-style solar powered outdoor lights knows that they are bright enough to show people where the lights are, but not exactly useful in providing actual illumination.  The d.light system isn't as bright as an incandescent bulb (or a CF, for that matter), but it does a reasonable job of lighting the area.  And since the cords between the lights and the controllers are long, you can spread them out to light a wider area or mass them to create more intense light.2. The lights are individually controlled and each one has a high power/low power option, so you can decide for yourself how to choose between brightness and the length of time your system will function without a recharge.3. The system is advertised as providing light for a long time.  One light on low power operates for 15 hours.  Operating both lights high power, the system operates for 3.5 hours.  But even that is a pretty long time if, for instance you are lighting a cabin, tent or garden shed.  Also, the lights glowed brightly even with just a couple of hours of sun.4. It is simple to install; all you need is a drill and screwdriver to install the 10 screws.  The instructions consist of three pictures and about that many some self-evident sentences. But that&#8217;s all you need.The flaws are minor, but  worth mentioning:1. It&#8217;s fairly pricey.  At $185, this system is worthwhile only if it&#8217;s going to last a while. Otherwise, you are better off hanging an LED-powered flashlight with rechargeable batteries from the ceiling. The system is guaranteed for two years, but since this is a new product, there&#8217;s no telling how long it will actually last.2. There is no mounting hardware. One would think that it would not be too difficult for the manufacturer to add the include screws to fasten the solar panel, the four screws to attach the two controllers and the two screws for the lights. It also wouldn't be too difficult to include cable staples to hold the wires in place, which are conveniently pictured in the instructions but inconveniently not included in the package. Did I mention that the system is pricey?On the whole, this is a good product for lighting a shed, exterior garage or a one-room summer cabin.","05 14, 2014",A39NB225G8LYPY,"Brenda Frank ""Eclectic Reader""",Get Off the Grid,1400025600

I don&#8217;t think any of the sprays reach their claimed distance.  Spectracide claims 22 feet.  The best I ever achieved was about 15 feet.  I am sure it varies in their controlled tests and from can to can, climate, etc.  For my use, which is typically near my deck or house or in my yard, 15 feet is plenty.This brand, Terro, claims to be able to be applied from 20 feet away.  I have used it at about 6-8 feet, and as much as 15 feet.  Beyond that I don&#8217;t think it reaches, and loses accuracy (hits a wider area than the intended target).It appears to be just as effective as the other brands.  I do think this is a better &#8220;day time&#8221; spray.  Most sprays tell you to use it in early evening, after wasps have returned to the nest.  Sometimes there are a lot of wasps about and you want to use your deck or areas right outside your home though, so you may find the need to use a spray in the daytime.  This spray forms a foam over its target, so it traps wasps, while also killing those who try to escape.As far as effectiveness on contact, I have found that Raid will usually result in an immediate kill, with many wasps falling out of the air as the spray touches them.  With Terro, it seems a few who made it through the foam died soon after, but maybe hung on for a few seconds, more so than with Raid or Spectracide.While the encapsulating foam is a great way to instantly &#8220;lock down&#8221; the nest and destroy its inhabitants, like any other spray, it does leave you with some clean up afterward.  Nothing that you can&#8217;t hose away afterward.  Depending on how heavy you apply it (it doesn&#8217;t take much to kill the wasps), you have a white foamy clump for 5 to 15 minutes.Terro says this product may be used indoors.  I would avoid using any spray of this type indoors.I have used it on my deck (pressure-treated wood) and against my house, near mortar and my vinyl siding (a tan &#8220;Cedar Impressions&#8221; shake style vinyl).  It doesn&#8217;t appear to stain.  It leaves some residue until it is hosed away.I would recommend this product.  I don&#8217;t know that it performs any better or worse than others, but again, if you plan to use it during the day when there is a lot of activity around the nest, you may prefer this over other brands.","07 14, 2014",A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B.

The log grate is extremely important; its function is to improve the airflow. The bowl is a bit shallow, but is able to handle 3-4 logs without trouble.The stainless steel legs are a really nice touch; it gives the fit pit a modernized look. The bowl is very big and roomy; I didn&#8217;t think so at fist when I saw the image. When the top cover is on it stands up to an adults thighs. The cover makes it really safe so children do not get to close to the fire. An ideal location for this pit would be in the lawn or patio area, it really catches the eye and entertains guests. The pit is very durable and can be used for many years as long as it&#8217;s well kept. It did come with a cover, which I felt was not good in quality, but as long as it keeps the rain out I&#8217;m happy. The pit itself is very light weight 30 pounds, which makes it easy to travel with and move around. I don&#8217;t see why a person could not take this on a camping/out door trip, the legs attach and detach quite easy. It would have been nice if it came with a grate for grilling, because there is enough space between the log grate and the top of the pit.Overall all I am pleased about the value of this fire pit and its functionality. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable fire pit. I can&#8217;t wait for a cool summer night to light up a fire and roast some marshmallows.","07 20, 2014",A1V81ZAUGS0LE3,Dinubabear,Sturdy Fire Pit,1405814400

I don't purchase junk, or spend as little as I can, however every gas powered anything consistently breaks on me in a short period of time. This is the reason I decided to go towards the electric side of things. Last year I bought a battery-reliant weed eater, and was nothing but exceptionally happy with that, so I decided to do the same with the snow blower. I was very concerned about poor power from the machine, however let me be one of the many people to tell you - you're going to have no issue with this thing!I live in NW Ohio, and we've been absolutely demolished with snow this year. We've set the record for the most snow in a given season (and that's even including the blizzard year of '78!). I didn't pull the trigger and get this sooner, and wish I had - my (and my boyfriends) back would have really benefitted if we had. While I wasn't able to truly test this on the big snow dumps we had, we just had a nice 4-5&#34; snow last night, and this thing performed miraculously well. I put it through its paces and pushed some of the older (and much more dense/ice-like) snow back, and this worked VERY well. As with all devices when you push it, it's going to complain a bit, however it did not pop any breakers like I've seen people complain about other devices, and while it bogged down a slight bit, I was pushing it to the rated limits. I haven't taken stars off for this, because my neighbors little gas powered beast does the EXACT same thing, so I see this as not being an issue - if  you want better power, spend more and get a higher powered device!The reason I pulled back one star is while I really like the size, power, etc., I'm slightly disappointed in the build quality - the chute that directs the snow comes in two pieces and is held together with a VERY small bolt, washer, and nut. I am happy this comes with a 4-year warranty, though, but really would have liked to see this built with a bit more heft so I wouldn't be concerned about it possibly breaking in the future during use.Bottom line: REALLY good power, slightly cheaply made, but ran really nicely and throws snow further than some gas powered equivalents!","02 9, 2014",A20SEVQ6ZDT7WN,Randygk78,"Great power, slightly concerned about possibly cheap design.",1391904000
B0096DD84W,Patio,"[1, 2]",4,"This fire pit requires only basic assembly out of the box to get it up and running. You only have to put together the ring (attach legs) that holds the bowl which, even for my non-handy self, took less than 30 minutes. Once together the unit feels stable, sturdy and fairly safe (though all of these small fire bowls are hazardous if used improperly), and looks good, too.You aren't going to be putting large logs in this fire pit, and the included cover is extremely flimsy (ripped on our second use), but this is an otherwise good-looking, solid fire bowl, perfect for roasting marshmallows or just backyard ambiance. The beautiful cooper bowl did immediately discolor with use, but that's to be expected, though it does kind of diminish its appeal.I like that there is also a screen to put over the top to protect little ones, and lawns and homes, from sparks. Once it's on though you can't remove it, for instance, for additional marshmallow roasting, because the metal handle will quickly get untouchably hot (duh!), so only put it on AFTER you're done using the open flame. (And even then we used fire tongs to do so.) You could, kind of, roast on the heat coming through the grate, but we lost two marshmallows on it that way and it was pretty messy (melted marshmallow remains today), so I wouldn't recommend.Of course, be sure you're using the pit on a stable, fireproof surface (concrete or stone recommended) as putting this on your lawn is just asking for trouble ... In the form of a tipping bowl of fire onto a flammable surface. Not a good plan. Also, make sure all fires are fully extinguished and be aware that fire bowls are usually NOT exempt from burn bans, so please check and make sure they're allowed and safe in your are before using this or any other outdoor fireplace item. In short: be smart, be safe and if in doubt, don't set anything, including yourself, on fire, OK? :)Currently, it's pretty pricey for what you get, and the bowl discoloration and worthless cover almost made me rate this three stars, rather than four, but in the end we enjoyed it enough and it felt well-built so I went with four, but it was a close call.","05 21, 2014",A2Q8GFSEUSGJ51,S.

So you can just take the cap off your 32 ounce jelly jar and screw it on instead of the jar that came with if you want to. It was already together except for the chain that it hangs from and that took less than a minute to latch on to the sides. It latches on very strong so it hangs safely and evenly.

I am no longer able to carry five 50 pound feed bags at one time...(Well, I actually never could do that but that is what I tell my youngest grandsons when they were young and still a bit gullible.  For the past 40 years I have had trouble with just one).Anyway...When I first found this cart at a local Wal-Mart I was not a true believer.  I bought the thing anyway and I must tell you that it was money well spent.  It is difficult to believe that such a simply and at first glance, rather flimsy looking contraption can and does work so well.  I was shocked. It is extremely durable!  I use this thing for everything from hauling in grocers from the car to gardening and yard chores and building projects.  And let me tell you about rocks - good grief - along with the lifting restrictions I find that I can no longer throw larger stones out of my yard and garden into the neighbor's woods like I use to be able to.  But with this contraption I can now simply haul the things with little to no effort.I feel confident that this cart will be good up to at least 50 pounds of weight although I never fill it that full.  It is completely waterproof and leak proof.  It is extremely well made and I have not had any parts fall off as I work which is really an amazing thing these days.Now as others have pointed out, when you pull or push this thing without any weight in it, it tends to tip a little when going over rough ground.  For me this is really not a factor as I do not move all that fast any more but I have heard a couple of my grandsons whine about it from time to time.  (I wish I could still move that fast!).If you check Wal-Mart or some of your big outdoor supply stores you will find that you can purchase this cart for less than they are offering it here.

These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods, whether it be steaks, burgers, kabobs, veggies, seafood or fish. Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature, I still start out by searing the outside. Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for?When I grill over fire (wood or charcoal), even when I try to prevent flare-ups, they happen. And when I crank up the Weber gas grill, it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food. Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling: Why? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing: Why? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats, you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy, but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect (caramelization), because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear. And, if you've used a marinade, and if your food becomes juicy, the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip....Hmmmm.....So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS: They, also, are limited in use: The tips are rounded, not pointy and sharp for easy piercing. These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies. Forget trying to skewer tomatoes, onion rings, peppers or shrimp. Take a close look at the middle picture, you can see how rounded the tips are. Also, notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer. What that means is this: You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole. Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable. Your food will definitely NOT hold in place. It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable, because it started out by going through a big hole.And I'm not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting: Foil wraps any way you want it to, and it can keep fluids contained so you don't lose the juices and so you don't dirty a pan. These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill.*I received a sample product from TeiKis for review, and I'm not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted.

The main problems with hummingbird feeders is they can leak, they fill up with ants and the wasps take over and keep the birds away. This feeder after being up for a week does not leak. They have addressed the other issues, but it will be awhile in Wisconsin before these other issues are tested. The area where the bird gets the juice has a raised end point to keep the wasps from getting the juice. The top of the feeder has a reservoir which can be filled with water to keep the ants from crossing over to the feeder from the hanger. I have not yet been able to test these, but they do seem like good ideas.One problem that I can foresee is that the water will evaporate quickly and will require attention. The container for the provided nectar fills the feeder about half way. Generally we just use sugar and water which is boiled to purify. This takes time and a  premix would be nice, though the one that comes with the unit does have food coloring in it which I see as unnecessary. The perches on the feeder are very flimsy but then...hummingbirds don't weigh much.  Overall you likely cannot go wrong with this feeder.

This needs dry leaves slowly fed into it for it to shred them properly. It can not handle any wet leaves (and when are leaves totally dry?) nor can it handle sticks/branches of any kind.If you are looking at reducing the amount of yard waste you place at the curb, you might instead consider a vacuum/blower that shreds leaves as it goes. The power of suction will normally create a better end result and they can handle items other than dry leaves slightly better.Now if you have a composting bin/box and are looking for something to allow you to shred leaves finely for that and can take the time to sort your leaves to select dry ones without sticks, then this device will work for you. But honestly you are the exception and I am guessing that most people think they can dump leaves randomly into this and not overload it...that just isn't the case.If this had metal teeth that could handle sticks and was designed to limit the intake better so it could handle dumping large amounts in, then it would be a 5 star product--even at the higher price required.

The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars.  Regardless, I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F.  Why am I mentioning this?  The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F.  Despite being well below the recommended temperature, the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised.  Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it, the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather, even after running cold water through it.  It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other &#8220;good&#8221; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard, I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight.  It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent.  Prior to obtaining this hose, I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied.  The female end of the hose is large and textured.  This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot.  I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses.  The male end is just as easy.  The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting.  I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting, but the connection still leaked.  I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting.  In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those.  Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer.  For now, I am deducting a star for that reason.  If it works better when it gets above 70F, I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $1 per foot on a garden hose, I would have thought they were out of their mind.  I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $30 works just fine.  However, after trying a quality hose like this one, I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow.  I highly recommend this hose!

This left me with about a foot of well degraded plant material, mixed with dirt, and random fine roots.  I started to jab the pointed  end into the pile. However, the wings which are suppose to fold down and then stir the pile, simply stayed up. I would pull them down manually, and when it was placed back into the pile, they'd immediately fold back up. &#34;At least the bottom tip is mixing up the mulch&#34; I thought to myself.

Perhaps the company changed the materials that they make the aerator from, or they changed the company that they subcontracted to mold the metal tip. If you look at other recent reviews, others have also encountered the tip bending over, or the wings that bend down so you can stir, not bending down.

That&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing since they make some decent gear considering the price. (They also make some really poor stuff as well.)This is one of their decent efforts. The main issue with the Remington, much like everything made by MTD, is that it&#8217;s intended for light-duty use. It&#8217;s perfectly fine for they typical suburban yard, but if you have a couple of acres to deal with, need something for commercial use, or want something that will last for a couple of decades, look elsewhere (I&#8217;d suggest brands such as Stihl or Echo. A lot more money, but a lot more durable as well).Starting/running &#8211; fired up pretty quickly right out of the box. It comes with oil and uses a 40:1 ratio (again, typical of most MTD devices). I did have to adjust the idle so it would run smoothly at low RPMs, which is easy to do (outlined clearly in the manual). It has a spring loaded pull rope which I really like. I have that on my Troy-Bilt machines, and it&#8217;s a great feature for folks like me with back problems. Rather than have to do a sharp tug to get it started, you pull the rope in a smooth motion. There&#8217;s a spring that compresses when you pull, and then releases. It&#8217;s hard to explain but easy to use and a great feature for ease of starting. The downside is that when the spring breaks, it&#8217;s a major, major pain to fix.Power &#8211; This has a decent amount of power (25cc 2-cycle engine) for getting through tough weeds, provided you use good quality line. Although this is attachment-capable, it does not have enough power to effectively run things such as a tiller attachment. It&#8217;s fine for most other attachments.Attachments &#8211; This has the typical split boom setup and will take attachments made by MTD (and their related brands such as Craftsman). I tried it with attachments from Troy-Bilt and Craftsman (an edger and a straight shaft trimmer head) without any problems.Weight/Balance &#8211; Decent on both. The vibration was not too bad &#8211; on a par with others in this price range. The grip handle is hard plastic but reasonably comfortable.Controls &#8211; straightforward. The build quality on some, such as the choke lever, is not great, so some care is needed to ensure it does not break. I like that the on/off switch is on the shaft near the handle so it&#8217;s easy to get to.Bump head &#8211; horrible! I didn't have much faith that it would work well since every other MTD bump head I've tried has been poor. This was no exception &#8211; feeding is sporadic and the force needed to feed out line puts way too much stress on the drive shaft (e.g., you&#8217;ll end up cracking it when bumping the line). If you get this, toss the bump head and get a fixed line head. You can pick one up at a home center store for just a few bucks. Yes, you&#8217;ll need to manually put the line in, but it&#8217;s very simple and far more reliable than the bump feed. Plus, you can use better quality line, such as Gatorline, which cuts through weeds much better than the standard stuff.Tip: MTD machines hate ethanol in gas &#8211; it will kill the fuel lines. I add both Sta-Bil and Sea Foam to my gas, and that has worked great. Zero problems with fuel lines, and all my 2-cycle machines have started and run well over the years.This is a decent choice for light-duty use. It&#8217;s not one of those tools that you&#8217;ll be able to hand down to the grand kids, but it will get the job done for several years (provided that you maintain it and use additives in the gas). The split shaft allows you to use this for multiple jobs, such as edging, or replace the curved shaft with a straight shaft. In comparison to a Stihl or Echo it&#8217;s quite poor, but, for the price charged, it&#8217;s a pretty decent choice. 5 stars since it delivers a good level of performance for the price.","03 26, 2014",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,Comdet,A decent value in an MTD-brand trimmer,1395792000

Very touchy to set and then put in place.  Jarring or improper setting of the trip bar can result in an unexpected trip (and possibly broken fingers).  This Tomcat Rat Snap Trap is super easy and safe to set.  Use hand or foot to depress the set pedal down until it clicks.  Bait is inserted via the bottom using the removable bait cup.  You never have to put your digits in the kill zone.2. With the old-fashioned wooden type trap, there is the possibility of the rat approaching the bait from the reverse side of the trap.  This can cause the rat to be tossed clear and result in a ""non-catch"".  You can bet the sly rodent will now be trap-shy.  With the Tomcat, the rat can only approach from the ""business-end"" of the trap (front or sides), resulting in a reliable catch/kill.  In the case of a capture but non-kill, the Tomcat's interlocking teeth are more effective that the old smooth metal bar at preventing withdrawal and escape.A well thought-out and effective trap.  More expensive than the traditional wooden ones, but the cost is justified, I think, by the superior design and performance of this Motomco Tomcat Rat Snap Trap.  Can be used over and over for years.  I really like it.","07 2, 2014",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,T.M. Reader,Great design:  Easy to set.  Sure catch.,1404259200

The metal was welded on well enough there was no danger of deformation or detachment when I did so. A little paint did chip off, however. Because of this perpendicular piece of metal, you can only drive it down about 6"". If your soil is a bit looser on top, it's not deep enough to keep the stake from wobbling a bit, but enough to keep it in place.The connection threads are really short - less than half an inch for both sides. I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there's a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you're just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.","05 25, 2014",A2L35P0VQE7LBN,wann,Basic needs,1400976000

Granted, it helps novice gardeners from making mistakes such as using a high nitrogen fertilizer on something such as tomatoes, but it also is somewhat unnecessary provided you read the formulation.This is a 10-7-7 fertilizer. The first number refers to nitrogen (helps with greening and foliage growth); the second is for phosphorus (promotes root growth); the third is for potassium (helps strengthen plant cells). It&#8217;s a good formulation for pansies but also can be used for other flowering plants.It also includes small amounts of sulfur (improves uptake of nutrients), iron (aids in plant health and improves the green color) and manganese (helps with iron absorption). All in all, a generally decent fertilizer formulation.The granules are small but not too powdery, and are uniform in size. It&#8217;s easy to spread and work into the soil. Watering after application is recommended and, given the high N content, you should take care not to get this on foliage (or wash it off if you do) to prevent burning.The cons are the cost &#8211; this is very pricey per pound, and there&#8217;s nothing special about the formulation to justify the cost. The other con is that only one-third of the nitrogen is from water insoluble sources (which for this fertilizer is feather meal, bone meal and meat meal). Water insoluble sources are important to prevent fertilizer run-off into streams and other water bodies, where it promotes algae blooms. While water soluble nitrogen works faster and gives you that quick &#8220;pop&#8221; of growth and color, it is not ideal due to run off.I&#8217;ll give this 3 stars.

It is all designed to be highly water soluble to get into the soil - or be washed away into the street gutter and into the groundwater supply.Part of my test result was tainted by the prior high nitrogen weed and feed fertilizer application. But it does illustrate the short term effect of nitrogen for a fast growing green yard (but not necessarily a long term healthy yard). This was the first fertilizer application in well over a year, so my yard was probably nitrogen starved. And it is still very early in the growing season following an unusually cold winter to make an accurate assessment. I lost some St. Augustine grass from fungus last year and some from the winter hard freeze. So I needed some high nitrogen fertilizer initially to spur growth to cover the dead areas. But next I'll drop back to a milder fertilizer like this.","04 19, 2014",A2AF0NOCM71J0B,"G. Cox ""Shanghaied""",Works Well,1397865600

It's been a few years since I'd last fertilized my lawn because of the damage done to my lawn with burn spots.It took less than 2/3 of the bag to cover my 1/10 of an acre lawn using a spreader. The yellow color of the pellets made it easy to see just how well it spread and there weren't any clumps to break apart.I'd waited until the grass had already turned green after the harsh winter before applying this, not wanting to confuse what nature would have done on its own with the effectiveness of the fertilizer. There were still some patches left where I thought the grass (and even my green weeds) were dead from last year.Well it's not going to suddenly give you this perfect lawn; that will require more effort on my part.  But the lawn is definitely a richer green and thicker than it had been and the brown patches are smaller and showing more signs of life.No burn spots from this application; a definite plus.Amended:  It's been about 3 weeks since the lawn was fertilized and I can only assume that this is why I've suddenly got a yard full of dandelions after we'd spent a lot of time and effort to eradicate them last year.  I'm making that assumption because most of the rest of the neighborhood, including the next door neighbors, have very little of these weeds.  Perhaps it's best to do a weed and feed before applying the fertilizer.Amended:  It's been two months since the application and wow, my lawn has never looked or felt so good.

Almost all plants need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (these they need the most and are often abbreviated NPK for the chemical symbols), calcium, magnesium, and sulfur (these they need smaller amounts of, I put Epsom salt on my lilacs because they like a lot of magnesium and sulfer).  Pansies need these minerals as well as iron and manganese (called micro nutrients, they only need a little).This fertilizer is 10-7-7 or 10% Nitrogen 7% phosphorus and 7% potassium.  This is actually on the low end for percentage of active ingredients and for flowering potted plans I usually choose 15-30-15.  Since the main reasons we like pansies is the flowers, I am surprised that the 10-7-7 ratio, usually you want to reduce the nitrogen (slowing the growth) so the extra energy is put into flowering.  But I am not an expert on pansies, so perhaps they grow differently.That said, this is really expensive for the amount you get.  It&#8217;s a little dusty to apply.

It will certainly not compare to any 2 cycle chain saw using a similar blade.On the plus side it has a long reach and the extension pole is very easy to install.  The chain, at least initially will get loose with avery short period of use and may slip the sprocket.  This will require that you use a strange allen wrench to loosen and then retighten the chain bar to readjust.  The battery charger that the unit comes with would be ok if were not for the fact that they offer a quick charge that reduces the time from eight hours to 30 minutes.  This will set you back an additional $43.  Also, you will probably want to purchase at least one if not two additional batteries.  These will set you back another $84.  When you add it all up you will be looking at somewhere around $260 about 2X what you started with which still is not that bad.  It will cut the dead branches though.  I am using it to go along my fense line and cut off the branches that died in the winter so that I can mow close to my fence when it gets warmer out.  I wanted a gas powered unit but the only available model is made by tanaka and I had a problem with the clutch and could not get the chain to spin and so I went with the Black and Decker.

Miracle-Gro makes their soils with a heavy content of peat, rather than composted peat or true organic matter which has broken down into soil or is about to. The content of most MiracleGro soils is about 2/3rds peat and the rest is some organic matter which is not quite broken down, a bit of dark soil (to help color the mix darkly), Vermiculite to help keep it fluffy and chemical plant food.While this mixture is GREAT for container plants (container gardens, house plants, seed trays, etc.) where you have a controlled micro-environment, I feel that in general MiracleGro products are not a good to put into the ground. Bag soils from this company can get too dry in hot weather, the chemical fertilizers included are not organic and tend to kill off naturally active insects and other soil creatures which actually help break down nutrients and make them easier for roots to take up. If you see a MiracleGro garden where someone has been heavily using that product, you'll see a garden where there are few earthworms because the pH is not right and the chemicals make them retreat. As well, once you get trees, shrubs and perennials used to chemical fertilizers, those flora will always depend on them because you've scared off the natural things that help them grow.

So with that said, I've used this for painting interior walls, using thick, not-thinned, latex paint.  And for me, it did much better than expected.The paint went on with very even coverage as long as you just sweep the sprayer back and forth.  As opposed to hand painting, the amount of paint used versus the amount of paint needed is significant - I used maybe half of what I had used prior with a paintbrush.  Granted, the coat of paint is much thinner, but that's also a good thing - it dried much faster, and if needed, I can apply another coat.  (So far, I don't see any reason to apply another coat.)The setup of this was easy - just add some paint, screw on the sprayer you want to use (small one for detailing jobs, big one for big jobs), and have at it.  You can change the amount of paint being sprayed as well as the force that the turbine blows the paint out (which, for latex paint, needs to stay at one of the more powerful settings.)All in all, this is a great painting system, and for the admittedly limited number of painting projects I've been able to use it on so far, I'd recommend it highly.  If you're painting more than a few walls, you'll probably get a return on investment for this system since you'll be using much less paint (and it goes a lot faster than manually painting, too!)

The gas mowers were difficult to start, unreliable, and a pain to maintain. This electric mower has literally changed my life. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. I don't get headaches from gasoline since it uses none. There is practically no maintenance at all. My favorite part is pressing a button to turn it on, just like a blender. If I am mowing the lawn and need to stop to move debris or if someone comes up to talk to me, I can turn the mower off without fear of not being able to start it again for a while. LIFE CHANGING. Never again will my neighbors point and laugh while I perform the rip cord dance on my front lawn. Never again will I plan my mowing pattern around the hill of my yard, to make sure the gas doesn't flood the engine.The cut is even and beautiful. Yes, if my lawn is thick and I have gone several weeks without mowing during peak growing season, I have to walk more slowly. But it is definitely more than powerful enough for regular lawn mowing and I would never call it underpowered. I always use the mulching mode and it looks as though the grass clippings have disappeared.The first time I mowed with the cord, I wondered if I had made a mistake. There is a trick to it. Cut your yard in half from the point where the cord plugs in. Begin at that center point and mow line by line outward away from it until you have mowed that entire half of the lawn. Then, return to the center point and begin line by line on the other half. In this way, the cord is always behind you. After 3-4 mowings I was so used to the cord that it isn't a bother at all.The wheel height adjusts from one wheel and is the simplest control of its kind in any push mower I have used.I wish I had bought one of these years ago!","06 19, 2014",A3R01WHD75L6FG,vamommy,So Far So Good,1403136000

I own a John Deere tractor which takes care of 90% of my mowing needs about the property.  However, the other 10% is landscaped and pathwayed and very difficult to maintain (especially in summer) with a string trimmer (my tractor would demolish these areas).  This little mower has a small diameter blade and is perfect for mowing on either side of pathway pavers and small grassy patches.  The mower was pretty much assembled in the box - all you have to do is attach the grass catcher, bolt on the arms, and charge the batteries.  Easy!  The only reason I didn't give the mower 5 stars was due to battery life.  I fully charged both batteries prior to use.  The first battery died after about 200 sq ft of usage and the 2d battery died after about 300 ft of usage.  I am currently recharging both batteries and will update this review if battery life improves.  Nonetheless, the area I needed to clean up is done for another week and took me little time to whip into shape with this machine.

Plastic covers are useless - they tear easily and rot pretty fast in the sun. The 2 ton canvas one we had last worked ok for covering the grill but it was heavy, got rotten after about 3 years and I think, because it kept the air off the grill, contributed to the rust problem we had.This cover is so light weight that at first I was afraid it would just blow off but, wonder of wonders, they actually put velcro in exactly the right places on the ends to tighten the fabric and hold it in place.

The description mentions &#34;Get up to 70 minutes of run time with the G-MAX 40-volt high-capacity 4 Ah and low capacity 2 Ah Li-Ion Batteries (included with purchase)&#34; which I didn't take as it includes one of each capacity battery. You get one of each which I was not exactly happy about. Additionally, extra 4 AHr batteries cost $149.99 list.On to the real stuff.I started looking at this when considering the various cordless electric mowers that are available. I like it better than the lead-acid battery based cordless mowers due to the size and weight of the batteries and the maintenance required for them. Our gas powered mower was getting annoying with starter cord breaks, oil and gas maintenance, and the self-propelled portion was starting to wear out. It was important to me to go green and make things simpler than gas powered.ProsOut of the box, this was so easy to set up. There was even a slight charge on the batteries to try it out (still, fully charge before use). It said &#34;team lift&#34; on the box but it wasn't that heavy. No tools were need to get this prepped for action.The first thing I noticed was the &#34;push the button, pull a lever and mow&#34; simplicity. There was no priming, no pulling the a starter, possibly multiple times, and no flooding. It just turned on and I was ready to go.Next thing I noticed was how light it really is. Coming off the weight of a heavy, self-propelled (weakly), all metal mower going to this largely plastic one was a gift. I didn't even notice it wasn't self-propelled. My initial thought was that it could easily have been built by Fisher-Price since it reminded me of my son's toy from so many years ago. Pushing it around is very easy.This thing is super quiet. Even more fun, it sounds like a bumblebee compared to the gas powered monstrosity I had previously. I even had a neighbor approach me after a mowing once with concerns that I was &#34;losing it&#34; thinking that, with my headphones on, I was pushing around a mower that wasn't running. I confirmed my sanity and explained the battery powered mower really does save your hearing.ConsI saw several references to uneven cuts and I would have to agree. Although some speculate that it is because the blades don't overlap, I think it is because of the mostly solid bottom of the deck. Most unevenness I found has been when dealing with dandelions that are so much longer than the rest of the grass. They tend to be missed if off to the side or dead center. There will also be some missed blades of grass on each pass, but I'm not meticulous about my lawn so it isn't an issue.There are quirks, too. I had the mower quit twice when it transitioned between batteries (the control circuitry uses one battery then switches when it runs out). Granted, it was early on and since then, I have only had it slow some, then kick in with the second battery.I also noticed that it adjusts the blade speed when the grass gets thicker. This is a great idea to maintain an even cut, except there is a time lag when you hit a change in the lawn. I have started working the system so that when I hit thicker lawn, I slow a little while the motor controller spools up the rpm's to handle the load. Minor issue, but the alternative is to have a machine that is psychic.The amount of time off full charge is a little less than advertised. It could be a smooth, even lawn that it was tested on so my irregular lawn might be what cuts the time down. I don't have a huge lawn, but it takes multiple sessions to mow it. Inconvenient, but I also don't get tired. If the weather cooperates, I get it done all in one day. Other times, it takes a couple.Overall, I am quite happy with this mower. I wish it had (2) 4 AHr  batteries instead of (1) 4 AHr and (1) 2 AHr. I also wish the motor controller was more responsive to changes in lawn resistance and better at the transition between batteries.None of this would prevent me from buying it again.","07 12, 2014",AY3D7DG5L5WCK,"Edward Walker ""ednpatty""","Great, lightweight mower for city lawns.

I didn't even know I had mice! So took the little bugger out to a distance field and released him and then set all 4 of the traps.

I just ordered a multiple catch trap as well as 2 more packs of these so I can get rid of more at a time.About the traps: I use a small piece of cracker smeared with just a tiny bit of peanut butter in each trap.

The traps must be checked each day or the mouse could expire, without access to food and water.Some people have questioned why teh traps dont have holes in the solid plastic for ventilation. I am personally glad they don't have holes because the mice produce a disgusting amount of urine and feces, which can spread diseases to humans. I'm glad all of this is contained within the trap and not leaking out on the floor or cupboard. I always wear disposable rubber gloves when handling these traps. I do not wash the traps between use because it is winter and I would not want to use my sinks for this.

B00BIX12CI,Patio,"[3, 4]",4,"I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004. It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and &#34;upgraded&#34; to the MM1800, the 18&#34; corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick.I decided to try to leave the Black and Decker world and see what else I could find.Bear in mind, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I did not want cordless battery power because I didn't want to have to keep batteries alive (some require charge/discharge cycles all winter) or buy new batteries.Corded lawn mowers are a fine solution. Many complain about &#34;cord management&#34;, but here's the trick. Your lawn never changes. Unless you are a professional landscaper (and if you are, buy a gas mower), then you always mow the same lawn. So the trick is to come up with a mowing pattern where you mow away from the outlet and never trip over the cord. Once you have a pattern, stick with it and you can mow quickly.I finally discovered the Greenworks 25022 20&#34; electric bag/mulch/side discharge mower. You can read my review there of that amazing lawn mower.  Since I have used the Greenworks for the past 3 years, I can only review Sun Joe by comparing it.The first thing I noticed about the SunJoe mower is that it was  far lighter than the Greenworks.  At 33lbs, it is exactly 23 lbs lighter and you can easily notice that as you move it around.  The SunJoe is really easy to transport around the yard and push on a steep hill.  It also has very large tires which makes it easy to push.  Unfortunately the tire tread is not rubber but rather hard plastic, so they aren&#8217;t the best tires in the world, but at least the size makes the mower relatively easy to maneuver.The mower was easy to assemble &#8211; just attached 4 hand-tightened bolts to assemble the handle and you are done.  The handle is a standard &#34;push the button and pull the safety bar&#34; handle.  The mower plugs in with a pig-tail cable, a very secure way of handling the power.  The mower is set by default to mulch, but there is a bag you can use.  The bag was a bit of a let down &#8211; there is a snap-in handle which just loved to unsnap as I used it.  There is also no side-discharge option like the Greenworks has - you can only mulch or bag.The mower also has an easy one-handle height adjust which made changing cutting heights very simple.In terms of performance, I found the mower did a decent job, but was significantly louder than any other electric mower I have tried.  This may be due to the all-plastic body construction.  I mowed my lawn while dry but a bit long and found that the mower did bog down on some of the heavier grass.  Trying an uncut patch nearby, I found my old Greenworks cut right through it.Overall, this mower gets a strong 4 stars.  It is lightweight, easy to use, and does a nice job on grass that isn&#8217;t too long.  My Greenworks mower still gets my vote due to the all-metal deck, the rubberized tires, the quieter operation, and more powerful motor.  But the light weight of the SunJoe will be less intimidating to many buyers, so I can definitely recommend it if weight is a concern..","06 26, 2014",A34CSXOGVYF94S,"Joel Avrunin ""Electrical Engineer who loves S...","There are better electric mowers, but this one shines in its light weight design",1403740800

B005G2SGG2,Patio,"[0, 0]",2,"I am a big fan of electric outdoor lawn equipment.  I have corded and cordless lawnmowers, trimmers, edgers, blowers, etc, from major brands such as Black and Decker and Greenworks.  I regularly mow my lawn with a Greenworks 25022 lawn mower and trim it with a Black and Decker plug-in string trimmer.  I have never owned a Remington trimmer, but I thought I would give it a try.On removal from the box, I was impressed at the ease of assembly.  No need to break out a screwdriver - the nylon cutting line is pre-wound and installed, and the plastic guard snaps on with ease.  The handle is tightened down with a simple knob.  As I picked up the trimmer and went outside to try it, I noticed the first strike against the trimmer.  It is heavy.  At 9 lbs, it is literally 2x the weight of the comparable corded string trimmers from Black and Decker.  Unlike some tools, extra weight does NOT help with a string trimmer.  It makes it a pain to use.I plugged in the trimmer which was easy thanks to the plug pig-tail, a nice feature over the plug moulded-into-plastic which B&D; uses.  The pig-tail means you can get a good attachment to a cord and it is less likely to fall out.  I trimmed my grass with ease, and then flipped it over to try some edging.  Once again, the 9# of weight make this a bit awkward, but I persevered.  There is a nice wheel on the front for making this easier - my B&D; has no such wheel, but then again, it is lighter so the wheel is less necessary.Of course, edging against a sidewalk will wear down the line, and I quickly found myself with a shorter and shorter line.  Unfortunately, the sophisticated &#34;auto-feed&#34; system did absolutely nothing.  I flipped over trimmer, tried my best to manually feed some line (not easy when it's an auto-feeder&#34;), but when it ran short again, it still refused to feed more line.It's not really for me to debug - every other trimmer I have owned just works.  This is a $40 trimmer that does not work so I cannot recommend it.","04 25, 2014",A34CSXOGVYF94S,"Joel Avrunin ""Electrical Engineer who loves S...",Heavy and unwieldy with auto-feed that will not feed - buy another brand,1398384000

These claws are the best thing to come along for that task than anything I can remember.When I was offered a review sample I thought they were cast iron - it turns out they are nylon, but are as strong as any metal utensils I have used. They are relatively light, rigid, but with a little give, and the pair of them can easily withstand the weight of a ten pound piece of meat (the largest size I tried lifting with them.)While these are excellent for lifting and transporting meat, they were designed to shred it and that they do. Once you get the hang of using them - a very slight learning curve - you can shred meat like a hungry raptor. There is sufficient room between the handle portion and the claws to keep you from burning or scalding your knuckles as long as you hold them perpendicular to the meat while you are working on it. Coming at a large piece of meat from a lesser angle can blister your knuckles. Also, the claws are pretty sharp and require the same level of respect as a razor sharp knife. But if you exercise caution and common sense these are completely safe.Although they are of nylon they will not easily melt. They can withstand 450 degrees F, so they are dishwasher safe. I will caution you to thoroughly clean them with a strong jet of water on the back side because there are channels behind the claws that can collect meat. Even if you machine wash them, take care to remove meat from that part of the claws because that is a weak point from a sanitary perspective. Again, common sense and diligent attention to sanitation will prevent problems.I tried these out the same day they arrived and am impressed.

For that reason, I prefer the smaller, easier to handle electric type. I didn't have any complaints about myAR Blue Clean AR383 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 14 Amp Electric Pressure Washer with Hose Reel, but I was glad to give this Karcher with similar specs and profile a try.Really the only thing I didn't like was the amount of assembly required and the crappy instructions for putting it together. I don't know when it became fashionable for companies to give all their assembly and operation instructions with pictures only, but I'd wish they'd stop and just tell us what to do. Fortunately, assembling the pieces of this pressure washer was not that bad, as there are only a few ways things can go together in the first place. All in all assembly took only around thirty minutes and I didn't use nearly as many bad words as I've used with other products.Once it was together, this pressure washer was very easy to operate: plug it in, press the button, connect and turn on the hose and turn on the washer. You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean ""sweeping"" action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car. Typical operation for cleaning the stairs and sidewalk was as expected: move back for a wider, slower spray, move in for a narrower, faster spray. Everything just worked. This one is slightly more powerful than my blue pressure washer, but just as easy to operate. A slightly longer cord and/or hose would have made it ideal, but I don't really have any complaints. This is a good product, but I'm deducting one star for the amount of assembly and the fussy, cartoonish instructions.

While I'm not a fan of poisons (I prefer snap traps), there are four different, very similar products, and it's hard to keep them straight:Mouse Killer (this product): Disposable, kid and pet safe, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I(Best choice!): Refillable, kid and pet safe, and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II: Disposable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It's as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there's no difference there. This one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don't have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don't work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can't get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is stillsnap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store.","06 26, 2014",A3V15SFD7918WZ,Jesse D.

The instructions were very clear, and I had no problem understanding how to put the system together and use it. I did have a bit of problem mastering the technique of paint spraying, and I don't think I fully have it yet, but I'm sure that will come in time. I tended to want to hold the sprayer a bit closer to the surface of the object I was spraying (in this case some shutters and trim on the outside of my garage) than was advised in the instructions, which resulted in the paint being sprayed a bit more thickly than I wanted. Again, that's my fault and not the sprayer. The instructions, as I said were very clear as to how to use the sprayer. Also, even though I was warned by a few people that there would be a lot of overspray, I didn't mask the non-painted areas off as well as I probably should have. The Flexio is pretty accurate as far as where the paint goes, but there is still a fair amount of overspray, so I will be more careful next time.Cleanup was easy, although there are a lot of little parts that need to be disassembled. Again, great instructions from Wagner, so I wasn't afraid to completely break the Flexio down to clean it. I was happy that Wagner also included a small brush to use to help clean away all the paint from the unit. Once it was disassembled and flushed/brushed out, the whole unit came away very clean, and it was easy to put it back together again.As a novice to paint sprayers, I was very pleased with the Flexio 590, and I can honestly say that it is a great product, and easy to operate, even for someone with little to no experience.

It does not keep out squirrels, but in 25 years I haven't found a feeder that really does.  Hairy houdinis can crack the code on just about everything.  Instead, I've learned to hang feeders beyond squirrel reach or use above and below baffling.  Unless one does that, the little baffle and wire grate on this feeder are ineffective.Why do I like it then?  This metal feeder is sturdy, of simple design, holds very little seed, and birds flock to it.  They seem to prefer open platform feeders, and this one has a nice low lip.  I have other expensive cedar platform feeders, but their sides measure 2"".  That may not seem like much, but birds do not like feeling confined, and they're always on the lookout for a quick escape if predators approach.  Consequently, this platform is much more popular than the cedar ones.Having clean and fresh seed in platform feeders is important, so its smaller 1/2 lb seed capacity is ideal.  The wire grate is removable.  I've elected to keep it off permanently which makes for very easy cleaning or tossing of sunflower hulls.  There are small drainage holes in the bottom, but I drilled in a few more, and it was a very easy process.This small feeder sits outside our kitchen window, and has endless bird traffic from dawn until dusk.

Once the seedlings are well-established, then I transplant outside.I used this mix to start some Papaver somniferum (annual poppies), and it worked as well as anything I've tried in the past.The reason there is a special mix for seed-starting (as opposed to regular potting mix) is that the fertilizer should be a little weaker, so it doesn't burn the delicate roots of seedlings.Because I could not find the ingredients on this product page or anywhere else online, I took a photo; you'll find it in the consumer photos. It's mostly sphagnum peat, with some perlite.As another reviewer mentioned, the mix is a little heavy on the peat for my tastes. It's easy enough to add perlite or vermiculate, another moisture-enhancing soil amendment, if you have it. Perlite looks like little white styrofoam balls, but it is actually a very porous volcanic material that resembles pumice.  It helps avoid soil compaction, improves aeration, and retains moisture, but it promotes better drainage than vermiculite.Whether or not you want to add perlite depends on the container and environment in which you are starting the seeds (e.g. the air temperature, humidity, amount of sunlight, etc.) as well as the kind of plants you are growing. Some love having their ""feet wet""; some don't.Overall, this seems a good medium for starting most seeds.

Instantly you can tell the ends are quality as they are heavy duty connectors, they didn't skimp at all.When unrolling the hose it didn't want to roll out, it &#34;remembered&#34; it's coiled position and I had a hard time putting the sprinkler where I wanted it because the hose kept coiling back up pulling the sprinkler. I finally turned the water on and after a few minutes of running water through it the hose straightened out.I really have no complaints over this hose except the price. I typically spent $20 on a hose, and like I said the ones I have used previously always kink so I do think this one is built better which would justify a higher cost, but at $33.99 it's a bit more then I think it should cost.

Exactly as it says the water just weeps out onto the ground.  I did have to readjust the hose a few times because if it has a sharp bend (kink if you will) the weep is faster before the kink than it is after (obviously).  I found that the readjustments are easy and the hose is fairly forgiving to being snaked around things without kinking.  I'm so happy I purchased it.

The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean. This one fits the bill; it is easy to take apart, fill and clean.On the negative side, I had a knee jerk reaction to the plastic bottle. Only time will tell, but I have had plastic feeder bottles that became brittle and / or cracked in as little as one summer's use. (Probably due to our mountain location where summer temps can hit 90 during the day and drop to the 45 at night.)For my purposes, this feeder is okay.

B00G8R2PS4,Patio,"[0, 0]",5,"My husband and I are blessed: we not only have a wee country cottage that we call our home but also a tiny studio condo in the City, to cut down on commuting 180 miles,  round trip for business and pleasure purposes. And one of the things we've learned is that almost EVERYTHING needs to be ""scaled down"" in size, for Urban Use, whether it's a patio set that only seats 2 people vs. 8 people; a small grill that can handle a couple of burgers vs. a side of beef, and even bird feeders...yes, even bird feeders.Out in the country, we have 14 feeders, ranging from multiples of suet feeders, feeding platform feeders, tube feeders and thistle feeders. Nary a pigeon, rat nor squirrel in sight, we don't have the problems of feeding birds that plagues Urban gardens.That's why, when I received this feeder, I instantly thought: BALCONY!!!, and that's indeed where it has ended up. Anyone who's ever lived in the city with a balcony knows ALL the problems: too small of a space, too shallow, usually metal railings that support nothing and slats of boards for floors so the 3rd floor is always messing up the 2nd and 1st floor balconies.THIS feeder is just PERFECT for small urban spaces, either vertical (condo) or horizontal (home) which still have no trees in their own garden, due to lack of space. Yes, it can be hung by it's sturdy and handy swivel latch, but it also has a very, very nice key-hole cut out on the back, making it perfect to hang from a simple nail against a wood balcony wall. And since it's so simple to open up the patio door and refill this feeder, it's small size is perfect for filling every other day.We've had NO problems with this feeder. Our metal top, unlike so many other's, fits tightly and snugly...there simply is NO gap between the top and clear walls. For the type of birds we're attracting: Mourning Doves/Chickadees/Finches/and Sparrows, the ample metal perch and strong seed catcher holds every bird that lands. We're lucky, in that a crab apple tree is directly outside of our condo window, so the birds have perched on our porch, forever. We've also had small metal trays of food on our tiny patio table, so they were used to coming to our home for food.We love this feeder. It's definitely a ""niche"" category; I wouldn't use it in a suburban or rural area, simply because there's too many birds that visit those yards and the shape and limited capacity would/could make this problematic. Much larger feeding tubes and platform feeders are the ones that work out there.But, for people who live in tiny spaces that LOVE birds and want to attract them, THIS is a wonderfully thought out feeder. If you have a relative or friend in assisted living, this feeder would be a welcome gift to have outside of their window to enjoy.Bottom line: Our feathered friends HIGHLY recommend it!

We use a Weber Genesis E330 in our home and a Weber Q200 for our frequent tailgating activities.  We have used the Genesis for two years with excellent results.  We have had two minor issues with the Genesis and WEBER Customer Service responded immediately and rapidly without any hassles whatsoever.  We have used the Q200 for almost TEN (10) years with outstanding results.  It is, without question, the best &#34;portable&#34; grill money can buy.  So, recently, when we wanted a grill for a high rise condominium balcony which prohibits propane, we immediately turned to Weber.  We decided to order the Q1400 Electric.  Right out of the box we were impressed with the rich appearance and full assembly.  The cord is relatively short (6 foot), but this is understandable for safety reasons.  We wish we would have ordered the optional cart, but a sturdy tempered glass top table served to elevate the grill to a comfortable level for cooking.  Our first meal on the new Q1400 was filet and lobster tail.  We were a bit apprehensive about the performance of the electric grill since we are accustomed to grilling on propane.  However, the Q1400 heated quickly and cooked effectively and evenly.  We could tell little difference between cooking with the electric element versus propane.  Our meal was outstanding.  We are pleased to have found the perfect solution for grilling on a condominium balcony which prohibits propane.  The ONLY negative we can offer is the fact that WEBER has long prided themselves on manufacturing their products in the USA.  This particular model is NOT manufactured in the USA.  We were disappointed to learn this as we support American manufacturing whenever possible.

Each trap is rectangular, approximately 4 1/2"" x 9"", a shallow 3/8"" high plastic tray containing and ultra-sticky day-glo green glue.  It's pesticide free, and ready and easy to use immediately.Does it work?  Yes, it works great on mice, rats, insects, spiders, scorpions, etc.  It also works on pet hamsters, kittens, birds, etc -- so use caution and common sense.Personally, I use mine exclusively for insects/spiders . . . in the garage (hiding it on the floor under a shelf where it collects spiders), and adjacent to a sliding patio door that insects occasionally slip in through.  In the case of the patio door, although the trap is 3/8"" high, I butt it inside against the raised lower frame rail of the door.  Insects do not have to climb to get into the trap, they simply crawl over the rail and down into the trap.  The curious and mobile spiders in the garage also have no problem getting into, and stuck in, the traps.An additional note about the plastic tray design.  I prefer it.  In my patio door application, I had previously used an Ortho Home Defense branded trap, in which the glue is simply deployed on a flat paperboard base.  Over time, the glue slowly melted and migrated onto my doorframe and carpet (where it continued to do its job, but also made a mess).So how about rodents?  Sorry, but I will not use this trap for mice, which will indeed become trapped - but also terrified and/or eventually starve to death (or even possibly escape, but with less than four feet).  With mice, I prefer to live trap and relocate.  For rats, which thankfully are not currently a problem here, I admit I will use ANYTHING (I had one invade once through a basement drain.  He laughed off the snap trap I used, but succumbed to the poison I put out).An additional note - This trap works only by trapping with the glue surface.  It contains no poison or bait.  However, I see no reason why putting a little food bait in the center of the trap would not enhance the success probability.","06 30, 2014",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,T.M.

I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the outside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent. This trap is safe and the bait station encloses the poisonous material inside (Bromethalin), and it is resistant to weather. It is preloaded and you don't have to handle the dangerous substance by hand. It is also kids and pet-proof. It contains a tier of bait-station which is about four ounce of bar bait. This is pretty large and long-lasting than one ounce station. This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This can be safely disposed in the trash. Another plus is that this can be used either indoor or outdoor. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully.

In fact, the only birds who even bother with this feeder in my backyard are those nuisance starlings and grackles.Depending on what I filled it with during my 6 week testing period - seed, suet, peanut nuggets or mealworms - the platform feeder did attract a few species of wild birds at first.  As a full-time resident of the Gulf coast of west central Florida where the birdlife is unusually rich and abundant, I have identified many species at my other bird feeders but only the starlings and grackles continued to visit this platform feeder, especially when I filled it with peanut nuggets or mealworms. (The squirrels, by the way, do not like the mealworms).I positioned my feeder in a nearby tree using a 36-inch ""S"" branch-hook which provides a lot of clearance around the feeder to foil the squirrels. The adjustable dome is designed to wobble and throw the squirrels off balance when they attempt a raid but my squirrels still manage to get under it, tilt the feeder and spill the food. I don't mind this too much though because I also enjoy watching the birds ground feed.The Perky-Pet platform feeder is made in China and requires some assembly. It is easy to assemble but the wire grate that fits overs the metal feeding dish is warped on my unit and is a very poor fit, leaving about a half inch gap allowing the squirrels a better foothold and easier access to the food. I have since removed this grate inasmuch as it serves no good purpose.The distance between the dome and the feeding dish is adjustable but the dome is also a poor fit and sits at an angle, wobbling and bouncing wildly on its spring with the slightest movement of air. It is not a bad looking feeder but I would visually like it better if all of its pieces were a straighter fit and the feeder didn't look so wonky.The feeder requires frequent cleaning which means dismantling the feeder. It's a bit of a hassle to disassemble the feeder twice a week but necessary to prevent disease transmission in birds through decayed and contaminated food.But during the process of frequent disassembling, cleaning and reassembling, I've done a little experimenting with this feeder trying to make it a more successful feeder for wild birds and this is what I've discovered:1. The grate really is useless so I just keep it off.2. The bouncing dome does not deter squirrels. Rather it scares the birds away. So I tried keeping the dome off in order to attract more birds. This didn't really work for attracting desirable birds other than nuisance birds. I also discovered that the dome is actually beneficial for keeping the feed protected from the elements and bird droppings. So I decided to continue using it.3. The dome does work better when I reassemble the feeder without using the spring. The dome wobbles much less and is more steady without the spring and therefore doesn't frighten the birds with that frantic wobbling.After all this tweaking I'm still not satisfied with this Perky Pet feeder. I most definitely would not buy another. Nor would I ever recommend it. In fact, mine has gone in the trash.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend theBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic. Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny. My Brome feeders paid for themselves in no time, just by what they save me in all the birdfeed that the squirrels cannot access.","03 4, 2014",AYWUHB7N8XGZQ,"Evelyn A.

B00HH4K700,Patio,"[0, 1]",4,"My upfront summary - a good mower that cuts my grass quite well, the grass catcher works okay but not perfectly, and the cord wasn't nearly as difficult to keep out of the way as I had expected.  If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won't run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It's not perfect, it's a little bulky compared to what I'm used to, and the handle height isn't adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn't fit you, you're out of luck.  If you're still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I've put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can't mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don't want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I'd always mowed my lawn, it hadn't occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I'd like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I've been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren't fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don't let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn't do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6"") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it's heavier and bulkier so it's more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don't wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It's a Black & Decker.  I've purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I've overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can't get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won't run out of power because it's cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5'9"") okay, but I'd like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you're shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you've got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It's always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that's both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren't overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn't easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it's easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole","06 8, 2014",A1J5HIF41ENSMZ,Adam Wood,"Nice mower, and having a cord wasn't nearly as bad as I'd feared",1402185600

B00G8R2JWG,Patio,"[1, 1]",2,"Update, April 2014:  My original three-star review is posted below. I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet.","03 10, 2014",A14EPTYN50XSZV,Someone Else,Updated Review.

B00HH4K700,Patio,"[0, 1]",3,"** updated with second mow at bottom**I really do enjoy mowing my yard... it's a little more than  1/3 acre and a push mower is good exercise.  My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22"" deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I've kept that gas engine purring and it's still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it's considered not as ""green"" as some current options.  So even though I'm a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I'd give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I've only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don't let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don't have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn't get a headache-  17"" deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I'm adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22"" gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It's light, so it doesn't feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that's right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It's a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It's likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn't get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a ""suction"" than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it's a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn't produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I'm really not sure of why it's there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don't have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it's great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn't as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won't be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don't yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3""...  but I'm interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I'll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I'm used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of ""Tokyo Drifting"" with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I'm putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I've used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn't cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It's okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that's not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that's really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17"" vs 22"" and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green ""street cred""  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I'll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3""...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25' extension cord to my 50' cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I'll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It's now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn't yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower.","04 27, 2014",A2IFKH3TJ10387,"Christopher Powell ""Christopher""",Initial Mow Review - Spring 2014,1398556800

It is not pre-scented with artificial bait scent as some other brands are. But this is not obvious on the packaging itself.- Yellow plastic bait panel makes it easy to clean dead mouse and used bait off for reuse. But at this low price why bother dealing with the yuckiest part of the whole process?- Sensitivity setting is not obvious on the package nor on the website.  It was only by reading another review here that I clued-in on what those markings meant.Overall:I would recommend going for the cheapest snap traps available and buying in bulk for areas with a continuous supply of mouse  activity.  I use this style of class snap trap along with a battery powered zapper for mouse control in our unsecured (mouse-wise) basement and in the attic.

Snap traps, glue traps, spin traps, and several different types of bait stations. Of them all, this is perhaps the last I'd choose (except maybe the glue traps... I hate to see animals suffer like that). While I'm not a fan of poisons (I prefer snap traps), there are four different, very similar products, and it's hard to keep them straight:Mouse Killer: Disposable, kid and pet safe, and can be used both indoors and outdoors.Mouse Killer I(Best choice!): Refillable, kid and pet safe, and both indoors/outdoors.Mouse Killer II(this product): Disposable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It's as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there's no difference there. That one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don't have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don't work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can't get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is still snap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store.","06 26, 2014",A3V15SFD7918WZ,Jesse D.

I LOVED that these cages broke down into small pieces, which made them MUCH easier to store, AND I loved that I could personalize how close-together the horizontal supports were.  They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.  Please read below.~~~~PROS~~~~~ Tall, Five-Foot Stakes-- the height of these cages means that I can bury the first six inches or so (for support/strength) and still have PLENTY of height for my tomatoes to grow with support.  Each cage comes with three stakes, each of which are steel stakes coated in a thick plastic coating.~ Sturdy Supports-- each cage comes with nine plastic support clips that can be placed anywhere on the cage that works for that plant.  For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don't expect them to last season-after-season.","05 4, 2014",A1RZJ25XHIYUBQ,Former Baker,"Fantastic for two seasons, but no more",1399161600
B00AA8WX52,Patio,"[2, 3]",3,"For several years I've been wearing Insect Shield (R) clothing when hiking and gardening.  Originally I bought permethrin-infused outdoor wear to ward off the mosquitoes, so I wouldn't have to slather my skin with DEET-based repellent every time I was outdoors.  More recently the Insect Shield clothing has become essential for combating the ""quiet epidemic"" of tick-borne Lyme disease here in New England.  After years of use, I can say unequivocally that permethrin-treated clothing is the absolute best solution for keeping insects at bay.  There have been times in the deep woods when I've been swarmed by mosquitoes and flies -- they'll bite any exposed skin (hands, neck), but they never light on the treated fabric.  It's like a force field.  It works great.  And I've never picked up ticks when wearing permethrin-coated clothes.The only downside, historically, is that I've had to buy shirts and pants that were treated by the garment manufacturer.  It meant I couldn't wear my favorite gardening shirt or my favorite hiking pants.  That's where this product comes in.  I can use it to give my existing clothes an Insect Shield (R) like force field.  It's awesome.  A great solution for outdoor enthusiasts, especially those facing real health hazards from insect bites (where Lyme disease, malaria, and other serious diseases are rampant).  I'm not thrilled about using any chemicals, but I'd rather have the chemicals on my clothes than on my skin.With this can, I treated one complete set of outdoor clothes:  a pair of pants, a shirt, a pair of socks, and a pair of shoes.  I followed the instructions and sprayed each item until it was wet.  I probably could have sprayed a cap, too.As one other reviewer noted, the instructions on the can are unreadable by eyes of a certain age, even with reading glasses.  I know can real estate is limited, but seems like they could have figured out a more user-friendly solution.Bottom line:  Permethrin works, and it works great.  The only question is what's the best way to apply it.  The primary advantage of this aerosol can is that your finger won't get tired from pumping a trigger-sprayer bottle.  But having used both this aerosol can and the Sawyer trigger sprayer, I strongly prefer the trigger sprayer.  It gives me more control, is less messy, and seems to let me saturate the fabric better.  Both use the same ingredient; it's just a matter of which delivery mechanism works better for you. Unless you have arthritis that makes using a pump sprayer difficult, I'd recommend the Sawyer 24 ounce trigger sprayer bottle for the most economical, easiest, least messy application.","04 15, 2014",A3NGOG8Z78AZSD,Edward Barnett,"Ingredient works great, but pump sprayer works better",1397520000

It's flimsy plastic, so you get what you pay for.Pros:- Plastic is clear, so watching birds is easy- The roof does help keep the bird seed dry- The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter- The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water- The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raids.Cons:- The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam.  Through normal use, these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate.  Luckily, super glue works well.- The opening is only big enough for a single bird, in my experience, without squabbles.- A single fall, if the suction cups give out, will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just o.k. because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time.  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder.  It's more accessible by squirrels, but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feeder.Tip:  To increase suction cup strength, clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup.

This seemed like it would fit the bill, and for the most part, it did. It arrived held together with zip ties, with a plastic laminated instruction card entirely in French also zip tied to it. (Although this thing is made in Pennsylvania USA, I guess they only hoped to sell it north of the border or overseas, unless PA has a hotbed French gardening community I don't know about.) We cut the ties, purchased a box for it (NOTE: box sold separately), and hung it on the porch railing. The design is simple enough that the instructions were not needed, and you don't even really need any tools, as the plastic nuts can be secured by hand-tightening. (That said, getting a screwdriver and pliers to tighten it is not a bad idea.) The brackets slide from about two inches to four and a half inches, and with a little cleverness and possibly some better fasteners, I think it could be made even wider than that. (I did not test my theory, so no guarantees.) Once we got the plants in, everything looked great. The minimal design doesn't make any decorative statements. It just holds a box of flowers. It isn't the sturdiest flower box holder on the planet, either, but it didn't fall, bend, break or lose stability while we were getting it set up or for weeks after planting.

B007VN2G5G,Patio,"[0, 0]",4,"It took me a while to really be able to test this spray.  For right off the top I feel I must tell everyone, this is not a conventional flying insect killer.  It does not come out as a fine mist, and it is not designed for just clearing an area of hornets horning in on your BBQ, nor for any kind of indoor use.  It shoots a powerful jet stream of thick  white foam at least a good 15 feet, and easily more.  And it really is designed to be a nest killer.  The powerful stream keeping you from having to get too close to any nest, and perhaps taking one down that is up in a tree from a short ladder, or maybe just from the ground. That being said, this stuff worked pretty well for me. I had to first locate a nest, and that took a while.  I was finally successful when way in my back yard I found an old window box that had been taken over by a large nest of yellow jackets.  They were actively meandering around the nest when I discovered it, so I waited till very late at night before I soaked it.  The foam comes out thick and white, but quickly liquidates and penetrates.  I used about half the can, and then checked it the next morning.  Although a few bees still seemed to be hanging around, they neither went in nor even got at all close to the nest.  It otherwise seemed very dead. I felt comfortable enough to take the nest apart and found a few living larvae inside, but nothing as to adults. They were all either dead, or dying.  I sprayed again what was left and then threw it out...The effectiveness of this seems somewhat mixed here as to some of the other reviews.  But all I can tell you is that it was effective for me in destroying a large active nest, and they have not returned. It's very easy to use, and as noted, I only used half of a can on a nest that was buried in an old window box.  It could very well be that this foam is more effective for some species of bees than others.  And it could also be that some people are not using it at the best time.  Just remember whenever you have a real active nest to take out, hit it with the poison either very late at night, or very early in the morning before sunrise.  That's the only time that all the bees with be in the nest, and the only time you can be pretty sure to get them all.  I did just that and this foam worked very well.

It is a handy size for portability & storage.  We bought the optional stand for it which makes it easier & more comfortable to use.  You can cook 6 steaks with room to spare & then pick up the grill & store it away.  The only downside to the Q200 (Q2200)  compared to the bigger Q3200 is that it takes longer to get ripping hot because it has 1 burner vs. 2 burners on the Q3200.  That  makes a difference in preheating time, getting a good sear and maintaining high heat.  But the Q2200 does a really good job if you just adjust your cooking technique to accommodate the lower heating ability.  It also helps to use a 20 gallon propane tank with the smaller grills instead of those little camping LP bottles.  You will also need to purchase a hose & regulator but it's worth it to improve the grilling capability.The Q3200 is quite a step up in grilling quality.  It has a lot more room, 2 burners & attached cart.  We tried it in very cold winter weather & it heated well (just took a bit longer to preheat), it seared well & maintained heat.  It is impressive for a grill this size.  Our steaks were grilled perfectly with excellent caramelizing on the outside & perfectly medium rare on the inside.It took us about 2 hours to unpack & put this Q3200 together.  The directions are very good and easy to follow.  Give yourself plenty of room to spread out the parts and take your time.  It's not complicated.The LED light is actually a nice feature (I was skeptical).  You can turn it to ""auto on"" & the light will go on as you lift the lid, shining light directly on the grilling grates.  As you close the lid, it turns off.  In the fall/winter we often grill when it's dark so this will get a lot of use.  You can also choose to have it off all the time for when you're grilling during the day.This Q3200 grill is not meant to be as portable like the smaller versions of the ""Q"".  It is attached/bolted to the rolling cart (included) & the 20 pound LP tank (not included) is stored/attached to the inside of the cart.  But, if you have a truck & want to tailgate with a bunch of people, this would do the job.The porcelain-enameled, cast iron grates are very nice but I really wish Weber sold a stainless version.  I don't care how careful you are, the cast iron grates are going to flake & rust (yuck).  We BABY our old Q200.  We store it in a heated room, oil the grates every time it gets used, do not use a steel brush or a brass brush, have never left it in the rain/weather & STILL, the porcelain-coated grates started flaking after about 4 years of light use. If we had used a wire grill brush, I'm sure it would have flaked much sooner.  We use a crumpled newspaper with tongs to gently/thoroughly clean our grates.  We don't want little broken brush wires on the grates & then in our food (this happened with a good brass brush we had used on our charcoal grill).  Everything else on our old Q200 grill is perfect; even the stainless burners.  These porcelain-coated grates are the Achilles heel of the Q grills.Yes, you can replace with ANOTHER set of these same grates but you'll have the same problem; ceramic paint flakes on your food!  We have stainless grates for our big gas Weber & our Weber charcoal kettle grills - they are the BEST.  You still get killer grill marks/searing without the concern of flaking grates.

Using a sprayer is much faster and results in a more professional looking paint job that is smooth without brush/roller marks. Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve, so it's great that Wagner provides test boards so you can get used to the sprayer.Having a wide sprayer and detail sprayer, with their own canisters gives a lot of flexibility on the types of projects you can tackle with this thing. The wide sprayer works great with straight up paint, but the detail sprayer needs the paint to be thin down quite a bit in order to spray it. With both nozzles, you still need to mask the areas you don't want painted. Even though there isn't much overspray, you will get paint where you don't want it to be, specially little specks of it. The Wagner allows you to control how much paint is sprayed and the speed of the turbine for more precise control.My only issue is that it does feel a bit heavy and tired my arms frequently.

I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the outside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent.

This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This can be safely disposed in the trash. Another plus is that this can be used either indoor or outdoor.

Light, fluffy, dry leaves work great; wet, sticky ones not so well.  Sticks break the line.The plastic on this feels a bit cheaper, but not by much.  It was a little easier to assemble, mainly because I had trouble getting the stand to fit in the holes on the Flowtron. Because the legs are independent on this, there were no issues with things lining up.I like that the legs are adjustable on the Sun Joe.  I had to jerry-rig a collection container (big plastic garden tub on top of a box) with the Flowtron.  With this, I can adjust the height to fit over the tub.  Attaching a bag with the bungee cords that both units have doesn't work as well as I would have hoped.  When the bags get half-full, they tend to pull out of the elastic.  I also tried putting the Flowtron over a garbage can lined with a heavy duty garbage bag, but when the bag was full it was impossible to lift it out of the can without tearing even the heaviest-weight bag.  Shredding over a bin (which needed to be close to the bottom of the shredder or the leaves went everywhere) and dumping the bin into a bag works best for me.The good thing about the Flowtron is that the whole unit pivots on the stand.  This made it easier to remove the filled bins or bags and also to change the line.  The angle on the line on this unit has the line hitting the bottom of the frame, which seems to wear it out quicker.  I also found the line easier to install on the Flowtron, possibly because of the greater flexibility of their line (I have only used the same brands as the shredder).This is much easier to store than the Flowtron.  The top half clips into the bottom, making it very easy to remove and nest together.  The legs can be unsnapped or shortened and the whole thing put on a shelf.  The Flowtron is best left fully assembled.Basically, I prefer the Flowtron, but if the price difference is big or storage is an issue, either one would work well.

So, I did enough to put this to the test before tiring and taking my machine home.I tried the various settings and there was some difference in the size of what came out. I was surprised by how much went through untouched on the coarsest setting. But, most was much smaller. This time of the year, the grass isn't tall enough to mow, so I couldn't test that shredder feature yet.Bottom line in use: it does chop up leaves. Comparatively, a line trimmer dipped into a trash can will do a similar job without the cost and storage of another item, but it is much messier. Yes, I have done that by fitting a plastic bag cover around the top of the trimmer and over the trash can. This machine is neater, quicker and easier, though.The assembly was very easy and the instructions were well written. The telescoping legs are a definite plus both in use and for storage. Extra lines are included. It will easily disassemble and store in it's original box. Since the height is infinitely adjustable, I'm going to experiment with using it for an out feed surface for my table saw the rest of the year.Recommended for those who have a lot of leaves they want to compost or shred for mulch. The extra step to send leaves through this to just save trash bags when putting them to the curb for pickup probably isn't worth the effort or cost.

B00HH4K8E0,Patio,"[1, 1]",4,"I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends.","06 17, 2014",AHS6PX6H22WW1,"H. Wang ""jwangamazon""",Good choice only if you have a relative small lawn.,1402963200

That being said, my feeble attempts at gardening have grown more weeds than produce, so I was quite excited about the possibilities this product posed for my lawn and garden.Unfortunately, the warnings on this product are a bit off-putting. You are cautioned to avoid contact with skin as well as to wear protective eye covering when dispersing this product. If that's the case, I don't think I want it near my food, much less my children. So, we were very careful about where we placed it--on the patio between pavers, and in landscaped areas where the children don't play. Even had it not been for the children, this weed preventer is not supposed to be used on grass, which wasn't clear when we ordered it. Likewise, it does not eliminate existing weeds, just prevents new ones from growing. For me, that was the biggest issue with this product--to have as many warnings as it does, I'd expect it to kill the weeds that already exist.The power spreader cap was actually not something that we found useful. The cap flips open, and the &#34;power&#34; is in the flipped lid. Basically, the product is like pebbles that fall onto the cap and then are dispersed outward. You are supposed to control the flow by tilting the entire bottle up or down, just as you would if you didn't have the power cap. Perhaps it might be different when the bottle isn't near to full, but it's pretty difficult to control the output. And it's not easy to disperse to smaller areas.

So I had the opportunity to try out the GreenView spreader, which is battery powered (and to share my disclaimer, I was able to try the product for free, but I have zero incentive to provide anything but an honest review).I opened up the package, figured out how to slide the bottom part, and opened up the tab that sealed off the fertilizer.  Note that it does come with a full load, but you can easily refill the container.  I spent a minute or two trying to get it to work, and no luck.  Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked; once I fixed that, I was up and running!It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing.  Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom, and a little motor whirs to life, doing a very nice and even spread.  Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly.  I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn (average suburban size) in about 5 minutes.  This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott's push-fertilizer (and much less messy).  And this product takes up less room than my old spreader; just sits on the garage shelf.  The battery life seems good.  It uses four plain old AA batteries, so in future years I'll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader (or my small hand-cranked spreader) offers.  My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer, and others without enough, but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn.  The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading, but I just had to give the handle one quick &#34;heft&#34; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line, I figured I would be laughing at the product, but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders.

One dose is lethal to rodents, and they die within 24 to 36 hours.

Few work effectively or for long, but this product contains DEET (N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide). However, at 25% concentration, according to my research, it will probably not repel mosquitoes for the claimed 10 hours. According to a study by the Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association, &#34;DEET formulations (20%-34%) offered 3&#8211;6 hours of protection.&#34; There is also some health questions about using DEET directly on the skin, especially on children (you should do your own research on these issues). I tend to use more natural substances directly on my skin (mainly a citronella oil mix) and limit the use of products such as this to only my clothing. Also, I tend not to wear dark clothing, which attracts mosquitoes more than lighter-colored clothing. It's also good to avoid wearing fragrances or using perfumed shampoo or soap before going outside.This product is great when used with care and realistic expectations. If you plan a long day out in the woods or at the time of year when mosquitoes are plentiful, carry this or other repellents with you to apply every few hours.

Put it on the ground, press the foot pedal, attach a broom handle - I had a broken one lying around - and it's ready to go.The first thing I noticed was the size of the foot.

It is extremely sensitive to lack of sunshine ~ even on days where there are a few clouds in the sky ~ if the sun goes away, so does the fountain! I love that it came with several different fountain sprays.

Even when using the taller fountain fixtures. I love that it keeps the birdbath water circulating ~ keeps it cleaner for a lot longer! Mosquitoes aren't quite here yet, but this should help keep them at bay.This particular pump has little rubber suctions cups that should stick to a bird bath that is GLAZED (maybe painted). My birdbath is concrete and it doesn't stick (I didn't expect it to). However, it sits nicely right in the center and doesn't move. The birdbath needs to be kept filled up so that the pump is submerged at all times or you'll risk burning it out.You need to keep that solar panel up high, facing as much of the sun as possible.

B00FQGS8HU,Patio,"[1, 5]",3,"First, I want to acknowledge that Cutter works--it works very well indeed and is an effective repellant. And where I live in Connecticut the deer-tick population is massive and those ticks carry Lyme disease (which I've had, it's miserable--it settled in my knees) and so I fully understand why people turn to products like Cutter to protect themselves. And I *do* use it myself on rare occasion when I know that I'm in a tick-infested area like a wet marsh or meadow. And yes, Cutter does work and probably as well as any other brand.I'm giving it only three stars, however, because the chemical that makes this product work is DEET which is a much more dangerous chemical than manufacturers would lead us to believe. It must be used sparingly and should NEVER be used on babies or very young children. It's far better to cover up the skin that to bomb it with chemicals. Also, remember that there are many natural insect repellants (look them up online, there is a lot written about them) and I grow several scented geranium plants in my container garden every summer to use for repelling mosquitos. Lemon-scented geranium is very simple to grow in a pot and breaking off a few leaves and rubbing them on your skin works very well. Also, you can still buy ""punks"" in some stores and online and if you're just sitting in the yard or in a park/beach, burning a few inexpensive punks will give all the protection you need.So, am I just being paranoid or is DEET actually dangerous? Well, here is what the EPA says on their site:Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.Do not allow young children to apply this product.Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.Do not use under clothing.Avoid over-application of this product.After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases. The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:Do not spray in enclosed areas.To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face. Do not spray directly onto face.My suggestion with products like Cutter is to spray it on your clothing and not on your skin. Tie a kerchief around your neck and spray that and it will protect your face quite a bit.I'm not trying to trash Cutter here, by the way. I gave the three stars because the product does indeed work quite well. But it would be irresponsible of me to say, sure, slather this on, without acknowledging that there are dangers. I have downgraded it two stars because I think these companies should acknowledge the dangers more--particularly for babies and children. But if you use it sparingly when you are in infested areas and if you wash up afterwards, it's probably an acceptable risk for adults. Lyme disease and West Nile are terrible things and I would have to say the risk of DEET dangers is probably low by comparison--but that does not make it 100% safe. Do some online research and draw your own conclusions. I will carry this Cutters with me (I like the dry-spray, by the way, that's not just hype, it's far less oily) and, when the situation is desperate, I will apply it.","05 2, 2014",A1O97WKID9L3IA,"Jeff Wignall ""Photographer, Author and Radio ...",You must know the dangers of DEET before you use this product,1398988800

B0007LQ3RQ,Patio,"[0, 0]",2,"Bought this about 4 years ago from another site (much more expensive). It worked well.The pole holding it gave out (wet soil from heavy rain and snow), and the feeder hit the ground (frozen grass). It literally smashed into about 10 pieces; I don't know if I even found them all.The interesting part of this story is that the thistle feeder hanging on the opposite hook of the pole and 2 poly rain rings (over the tops)  did NOT break. Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn't guess which one. DUH. I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!?I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos. I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support. They won't replace the feeder.Be ware of expecting any type of replacement or support from the company. The emails were almost accusative; really off-putting, as if to discourage further contact. And I had shown them a photo of the pole AND the other elements on it which did not break. We exchanged probably half a dozen emails.I'd like this feeder again, but I'll be d....d if I spend money on something which is NOT supported when the mfgr says that it is supported for a lifetime replacement.Whose lifetime? An ant's?Probably made of SHODDY MATERIAL with a limited life is my conclusion.The company will insist that ""some"" animal attacked it, and they don't support animal attacks.

Dealing with the long and heavy extension cord while hot and tired was just too much.  I knew a gas trimmer would be way too heavy and bulky for me.Because my old trimmer was a black and decker, I was able to use the same string spools.  On one hand this was great, because I had 4 new spools.  On the other hand, I was hoping this trimmer would use thicker string.  I have chain link fence around the majority of my yard, and I would normally go through 3 spools of string each time I used the electric trimmer.  I assumed it would be the same with this Black and Decker LST420 trimmer.  Not the case.  I don't understand it.  Maybe it's because it rotates faster and is more efficient.  I don't know.  Whatever the reason, I am extremely happy about it.For my purposes, I am not a fan of the edging/wheel.  A lot of my sidewalk areas are higher than the yard level.  I found in these areas, the edger didn't work well.  On part of my driveway where they are the same level, it worked fine.  I also had trouble getting close to an area at the base of my porch, because the wheel seemed to hinder the reach of the string.I am very happy with this trimmer, and it is such a relief not to drag around that cumbersome mega-long extension cord (about 100' cord).","06 18, 2014",A3N4CUW4UYC9I3,MH,Now I don't hate trimming nearly as much,1403049600

I also like the ability to fold the handle and store the mower in a vertical position. It was very easy to set up and required almost no assembly.  It is far more heavier that the units without self drive so if the drive unit fails its not feasible to push by hand. It takes some getting used to navigating it in tight spaces.

I compared this product to my TORO handheld electric blower/mulcher with chrome impellar and a Craftsman gasoline chipper, mainly ued for branches and incidentally leaves.Packaging is pretty good and everything arrived undamaged.  It was pretty easy to assemble; I did not even need to use instructions!  The legs are made from aluminum and are height adjustable (with measurement markings).  Even if you are fairly short or tall, you should be able to set the height to your liking.  The rest of it is made from sturdy plastic.  The motor is quite strong and since it's electric will require barely any maintenance.  The cutting mechanism is merely heavy guage weed wacker string.For dry leaves and thick twigs, I thought this shredder worked fairly well.  I mounted it inside my garbage can, since I didn't have any wide mouth bags that would fit (and it doesn't come with one...)  Ear protection and eye protection are a must as this thing gets very loud and the top is fairly open and could potentiall throw twigs out.  After the first couple handful of leaves, the fine dust coats the hopper and makes most of the leaves slide into the shredder easily.  Sometimes, I used long twigs to help it along.  I confess, it was tempting to use my hands to mush the leaves in, but if you look into the mouth of the shredder, you realize it will take your fingers off and mangle your hand, in less than a second.  I fed this machine a mix of dry pear leaves, pine needles, and twigs of varying sizes.  What I got was some nice mulch quickly which I then dumped promptly into my garden bed. I also got a runny nose from all the fine dust, so if you have a surgical mask, I recommend you wear that too.  The legs pop off easily and I store all the pieces inside one of those very large black plastic disposable planters.For comparison, the SunJoe is is farily well built compared to the other two tools I mentioned above.  You have to have a lot of patience with the TORO if you are going to mulch a large pile of leaves with it since the vacuum intake is a bit smaller and long twigs jam it up pretty easily.  The Craftman is like bringing a bulldozer to a garden bed if all you want to do it mulch leaves and twigs.  As a one-task machine, the SunJoe works quite well.","01 14, 2014",A1HFT68GJ42LTM,AverageGuyShopper,Perfect size leaf bits,1389657600

Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood.","03 1, 2014",A14Z6D3IRJ23F7,"Chris F ""root""","The best splitting axe, hands-down.",1393632000

B00DK494IM,Patio,"[4, 6]",3,"I've had this bird feeder for about two years, and like it so much that I got another.  The feeder gets a lot of clinging bird action, much more than other wired feeders in our yard.  The birds seem to prefer the fly-through openings, and they have no problems pulling out sunflower seed through the wires.  Squirrels extract seeds too, but with difficulty.  They can wriggle through two circular holes at once, with a tail poking out one end and a head sticking out the other.  While that's comical to watch, it's not fun seeing determined squirrels try to bend and break the wire mesh.  The feeder is now off-limits to them.I like the easy-fill cap, all-metal construction, and the fact birds can land anywhere to get a seed.  It does create somewhat of a mess on the ground, but that goes with the territory of bird feeding.  I never tire watching birds at this feeder, especially during wintertime when activity is high.UPDATE:  While the second feeder I just received resembles the first feeder in looks, it is apparent Perky-Pet has cut some corners.  The wire construction (particularly where connecting with the metal framework) is shoddy workmanship.  I can easily push the interior wires in (leaving an open gap).  They used to be solidly connected (soldered) to the metal square and circle framework.  Just imagine what a pesky squirrel could do with those wires now.  The wire itself is no longer coated either, so I wonder how long it will take before rusting begins.  The easy fill cap design has also changed for the worse.

It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.

When I was offered a review sample I did not have grilling in mind. The clamp looked like it would fit a microphone stand and that is what inspired me to undertake a review.When I first received it I could not believe that the on/off marking on the top of the lamp was a real switch. It looked as though it was painted on the casing, but someone forgot the switch. After loading it with batteries a mere touch of the marking switches the light on and off. It's pretty clever actually and one of the reasons why I gave it five stars.The battery compartment requires a small Phillips head screwdriver to access the compartment. It's a pain, but it has a purpose: it keeps the compartment waterproof. I tested that by actually submerging the light in a sink basin filled with water. It remained lit and was no worse from my experiment after I removed it and dried it off. So if you do use this for outdoors grilling and forget to bring it back in, it will probably survive the elements for months.I use mine as a handy flashlight that I can conveniently affix to a mic stand. When I need to illuminate a section of a dimly lit stage, a few turns on the clamp screw releases it and I can use it as a conventional flashlight.

The quick connectors work very well for getting the unit set up fast and there is a range of wands for different applications (including a scrubbing kit which I'd not seen before). The unit looks more or less identical to the old one, containing a holster for the spray and a holder for coiling the cable.In terms of pressure, it's extremely powerful, second only to the much more expensive gasoline washers and better than the previous Karcher. To compare both machines, on a dirty driveway I would have to hold the wand of the old machine only an inch from the ground to create enough pressure to remove stains and ground-in dirt. On this model you can comfortably use a 4-5 inch spread to achieve the same effect which makes the job much, much faster.

This model this model is lightweight and comes with a plastic sheath with pen clip. The packaging says that the measuring range of this thermometer is -58F-572F.There are three buttons on the thermometer, a hold button, the on/off button and the degrees Celsius/degrees Fahrenheit button. You have to press down firmly on the on/off button to get the thermometer to turn on. My only dislike in this thermometer is that the buttons are very small and I found myself having to use a fingernail to get them to work as my finger was too large and sometimes I would hit the other buttons. This is why deducted one star. Within seconds you are ready to take the temperature of your favorite cut of meat.  I compared the readings with this thermometer to another digital thermometer I had and they were both within a tenth of a degree. The feature I like best about this thermometer is the hold button. Before withdrawing the thermometer from the food, when you press the hold button it will hold the temperature reading until it is pressed again. This prevents the thermometer's temperature to fall drastically when testing another part of the meat. It also has a nice battery saving feature as it will turn itself off after 45 minutes if no buttons are pressed. It also has a nice chart on the back of the packaging  to tell you what the proper temperature of each of your meats should be.Overall, this is a great value for the price.

I use the battery-based trimmer for properties with small yard. But two properties have a 1/4 acre yard with quite some think grass and some heavy vines also. My battery-based trimmer can barely handle the thick grass and it always struggles with the vines.I am glad to get the more powerful gas trimmer. This Remington RM2510 Wrangler is pretty lightweight...about the same weight of my 40V battery-based trimmer. The included manual gives very clear instructions about how to prime the engine and how to start it. I have no problem to start the engine. This is my 1st time to use gas-powered tool, and I am surprised how easy to start the engine. So far, based on my limited usages in one month, it usually starts within 3 pulls. The start-up instruction is also printed on the air filter hosing. So, no worry to keep the manual book around.Though it is more noisier than my battery-based trimmer, it's still in an acceptable range. This trimmer balances itself quite well. Even better yet, the curved shaft makes the trimmer head in parallel position against ground when I stand up-right. This really eases my back, especially when I use this trimmer for long period of time on the 1/4 acre yard.When it runs, the shaft does vibrate, which does not occur to my battery-based trimmer. After 40 minutes of usage, my arm does not feel sour. So, I think the vibrtion is not that bad.The trimming line is about twice as thick as my battery-based trimmer. I guess the line will last longer. When in high rpm, this trimmer sweeps through thick grass like chopping off cake with knife. And it rips though the vines easily.The package comes with a bottle of oil to be mixed with gas by user. However, the 40:1 pre-mixed gas can is widely available in Home Depot or Lowes already. The pre-mixed gas is in an easy-to-use metal can. Better yet, they add gas stabilizer additive to keep the gas last longer in the can.

I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you leave it for couple of days. I usually leave it right next to the walls, on the inside of my garage. After three or four weeks, I have noticed that the poison has been consumed by the menacing rodent.

It is preloaded and you don't have to handle the dangerous substance by hand. It is also kids and pet-proof.  It contains 1-ounce bar of bait per station with two stations per box. This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This box can be safely disposed in the trash. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully.

There was a lot more assembly required then I would have thought. It took my husband a little over an hours to unpack, assemble and dispose of the packaging. So, it was pretty quick. He said the installation was easy and intuitive with good instructions. Now, my husband tends to by very good at putting things together. The installation may take a little longer for most folks.The grill itself was easy to use and did a wonderful job of cooking, although cooking with propane is a little different than cooking with charcoal. (I&#8217;m sure many of you are rolling your eyes and thinking &#8220;DUH&#8221; right now&#8230;.)I have two criticisms about this grill. The first is that the side tables snap up and down, and they are very difficult and latch. This may get easier as they become more worn, but ultimately they feel kind of cheap on what is an otherwise well-made and gorgeous grill. The other criticism is very slight, but the drip pan is a disposable aluminum tray.

SET YOUR CUTTING BLADES HIGHER...............This product has made a visible, positive improvement in the appearance and strength of our lawn:The grass is darker green and more drought resistant.  It is a ""healthier"" lawn, if you will.  The grass is thicker and stronger and crowds out a lot of weeds. In fact, the weeds seem to be repelled. Achieving his lush lawn was relatively simple using a standard fertilizer spreader.This is an organic fertilizer . Here's a brief review of the two major nutrients in lawn fertilizers:Nitrogen (N)Nitrogen is the most important nutrient in lawn fertilization. It helps grow a dense, thick lawn, by stimulating the grass plant growth, and keeps the grass green. This is the lawn food that is depleted most rapidly, but applying too much can create too much top growth and increase the need for mowing.The vivid,  dark emerald green of a lawn can be easily achieved by applying more nitrogen  (caution:  A lot of flowering plants, like peonies, do not want so much nitrogen).Phosphorus (P):Phosphates on the other hand are helpful to strengthen the root system of your lawn. Too much  run-off and leaching of phosphorus used to fertilize lawns can lead to the excessive build-up of algae and weeds in nearby lakes. For that reason, some areas suggest that you limit phosphates in lawn fertilizers to help preserve the local environment and  pose less of a threat to groundwater.  PHOSPHATES MAY EVEN BE ILLEGAL IN SOME AREAS.Mature lawns will have a lower requirement for phosphates.As this fertilizer has 0% PHOSPHATES, It can be a very helpful fertilizer.  Be environmentally friendly, conform to the legal requirements of your local area and still have the best lawn on your block!","04 21, 2014",A1Q7A78VSQ5GQ4,"Nice Lady ""a reasonable person""",GREAT RESULTS: THE LAWN IS DARKER GREEN AND MORE DROUGHT RESISTANT.,1398038400

We placed this side-by-side with two other similar style feeders and it is the most popular of the two right now (All three have the same feed). I believe the birds like it for the larger holes/access ports. The squirrels have left it alone (or gave up on it) as we haven't seen any on or attempting to gain access to the feeder. That being said they do sit underneath it and wait for the picky bird eaters to throw down the seeds they don't like. Smart little rodents. The colors and materials which are metal are quite nicely painted and coppered. The only part that concerns me tis the plastic sheeting windows. They seem a bit on the thin side, I am presuming so they can be bent to fit the curve of the feeder, but I question how long they will survive summer heat and winter cold. I will update the review should they ever wear out. For now they are holding strong and allow us to see when the feeder is getting low. Glass would be a nicer alternative but would likely drive up the price of the unit.The other part I don't care for, but I suspect is part of the squirrel retardant features is that the wire loop it hangs from creates a lot of movement when a feathered friend comes to land on one of the stems. The feeder rotates around the wire and spins at a moderate rate until resting again naturally. This doesn't seem to bother the smaller birds, but the jays and cardinals don't care for it and pick the older feeder that has a sold bracket and does not spin.Overall I am happy with this unit so far and would give it 4 stars.","03 20, 2014",A1BHSP8TPTH8Y5,"CCGal ""MyReviews""","Nice option, Good to look at, a bit moving",1395273600
B00DK494IM,Patio,"[0, 0]",4,"I have had a similar feeder for several years.  It looks similar to this, but has only round holes (I like the round and square on this), a copper colored top, and a platform on the bottom.  I can't find it on Amazon to provide a link.  It has been one of the birds' favorite feeders, especially the chickadees.  I fill it with black oil sunflower seed and they like having all of the places to access the seeds.  I have trouble with deer in my feeders and they tend to leave these alone, possibly because tilting them does not allow all of the seed to fall out.  Although the feeders don't provide seed protection from the elements, they empty it quickly enough that it has never been an issue and I have never had a feeder filled with rotten seed.There are a couple of drawbacks with both feeders.  The &#34;fly through&#34; holes allow small birds to perch while eating, but they also take up a lot of space, so the feeder does not hold a whole lot.  The squirrels also can access the seed and they break the wire.  This makes it difficult to fill the feeder without losing lots of seed.  Even new a fair amount of seed comes out the sides, so I fill it over a platform feeder.  The platform the other feeder has on the bottom catches some of the seed that falls out during use.  This does not have the platform.  The other feeder's copper top is also more attractive than this plain black one.Still, this has quickly been just as popular with the birds as the copper version.  Due to the size of the holes, it is really only suitable for sunflower seeds in the shell, but that is the most popular seed in my area, so that is no problem.  I think other large seeds, such as safflower, might also work.","03 19, 2014",A3UKWQS8SRW6IO,OrchidSlayer,"Nice, but has issues",1395187200

B00GVLDF9K,Patio,"[3, 3]",5,"Full disclosure:  I am a Perky-Pet fanatic for the most part.  Other feeders occupy hanging space but not one of them is as popular as any of the Perky-Pets.  The birds must know quality better than most.  This one is glass and frankly, I am a glass snob with vigor.  Glass cleans better and lasts longer while apparently not leaving any residue from cleaning.Let's start at the moat top.  Instead of having to arrange a separate contraption such as I have previously and will do again this year, this feeder has an area in the top that permits visitors from below to stop by and drown.  I've always wondered if the dead creatures would be eaten by the hummers, but I have no evidence of that taking place.  But I always look.  The red top unscrews to permit full cleaning of the glass container.  I used a metal rod for holding plants to stakes to configure a tie down for the top's hanger.  It works well for me and I can control the size.The pinch waist permits more steady control of the feeder when holding or going from one location to another, but the real sensible addition to this feeder is the hummers' goodies (food) goes into the bottom instead of the top.  Picture turning the feeder upside down with the top engaged onto the glass feeder and pouring the food into the feeder while it is sitting on the sink.  When you have filled the feeder to the level you want, screw the bottom of the unit while still upside down and carry it to the feeder.  At that point turn the unit over and place it on the Shepard's hook or whatever you use to hold the feeder.  The incidence of spillage will reduce immediately.  (As was said by someone who could spill a steel rod.)After screwing the roosts onto the main unit and assuring their proper place in front of the little feeder holes the rest is as simple.  The bottom consists of two pieces which helps with keeping the entire unit clean and the hummers appreciate it.Right now, this unit has jumped from last to first in one week's use.  Another Perky-Pet occupies that #1 position and in a few days it will be joined by another family member.  Those little critters provide so much joy to us and some of our neighbors.","05 4, 2014",A3963R7EPE3A7E,"John N. Schar ""cxxi121""",Best Design So Far; Hummers Love It,1399161600

It falls somewhere between my go toToro 51480 Corded 14-Inch Electric Trimmer/Edgerwith Walk-Behind Edging and theBlack & Decker GH710 GrassHog 14-Inch 6.0-Amp Dual-Line Trimmerthat I got completely frustrated with and took back to Lowe's. I have to say, though, this Remington is definitely the heaviest string trimmer I have tried. I don't know if it's because of the powerful motor or sturdier materials, but this thing weighs a ton. And despite the adjustable handle, at its longest it is too short for me (I'm 5'11"") and causes significant back strain. It also adjusts head angle and switches over to an edger, but the kludge-y design requires physically moving and adjusting the handle when changing between functions. Also, there are lots of buttons for making the adjustments, so to get the most out of the trimmer - and in some cases just to operate the thing at all - you will have to read the manual. There are some pluses among all the drawbacks though.For use as an edger, they supplied a guide wheel that allows you to set the thing down on the sidewalk, so at least when edging you don't have to support the entire weight of the device. I also liked the double string head, which really tears into grass quickly, easily, and cleanly, taking everything out in just one pass. The feed mechanism is like the Toro's, where you have to stop the engine ""for two seconds"" then restart it to feed about a quarter inch of line. This works sporadically at best and requires good timing and patience. After a short while, I learned to listen for the feed ""click"" and knew I was good to continue on, but practically speaking, it's slow going when you can only go two feet or so before having to wait a few seconds (or more for multiple feeds to catch up on the correct length) before continuing with the operation. Still, with all the power supplied, when you have the line out, its quick work and as I said, does the job in one pass. I haven't had to change the line yet, but I suspect it is more or less like every other double-line string trimmer and that will be a pain as well. (No way around that, though, so no stars deducted for that.)Overall, this has some good features and some not so good features. For a stronger, shorter person, this might be just the trimmer for you. At this price point for a double-line corded trimmer, I think the cons and pros balance out and make this just an average trimmer, which is why I rate it at three stars.","04 22, 2014",A3QS4WWC1LCA6H,"Eric C.

B005FMZ4WM,Patio,"[1, 1]",4,"I used this to clean my house, which is vinyl sided with wood window frames. It's been about three years since I last washed the siding so it was pretty dirty and had a nice collection of pollen in the nooks and crannies. I have a pressure washer but I used the optional application given on the label and mixed 12 oz of HS01 with one gallon of water in a garden pump can. I wet the siding with a garden hose and then sprayed the Krud Kutter solution, working from the top down, making sure to give it a n even soaking. I waited about 10 minutes then sprayed it off with the garden hose. Some of the shaded areas had mildew growing and I had to lightly scrub these areas with a soft bristled brush on an extension pole. But the over all process with just using the solution did loosen the dirt and pollen and the hose spray washed it all off. I would consider this average results when using this method without using a power washer. After touching up some areas and brushing some of the white trim, I let it all dry. The house looks like it has a fresh coat of paint. It took two and one half gallons of mixture to complete my siding on a 1 1/2 story home that is mostly vinyl finish.Other observations: my front porch is painted concrete and my outside doors are steel. The Krud Kutter cleaned all of this with just a spray down and then hosing it off. The white trim is very bright after cleaning it, however, the white gutters had stains from rain drips and the downspouts have black stain (not mold). This product did not remove the black stains. I didn't try it on my wood deck, as there are products that are made to do that job specifically. I don't like to use my power washer on my vinyl, just a personal preference. I washed a patch of the concrete driveway, in order to use up what was left in the last pump can. the solution lightened the concrete by removing ground-in dirt, but only slightly. Concrete usually requires a power washer for clean anyway. The Krud Kutter cleans the grime from windows, but it does leave some streaking. There was no irritation of my skin, eyes, or sinus'. The smell is ok and dissipates quickly.I've used several similar products to clean the siding over the years, this one cleans a little better than the ones that I have used.

B001AN7RGG,Patio,"[0, 0]",5,"I have been starting fires for a long time. For my grills and smokers, I know that sentence makes me sound like a pyromaniac, but I am not.  I normally use charcoal for the grills and smokers, sometimes I use wood chunks.  I do not use lighter fluid because I am not a big fan of the chemical tastes it imparts to the food.  Plus liquid lighter fluid is just plain blasphemous to any legitimate Master of the Grill.  We would rather boil a rack of ribs than use lighter fluid to start a grill.I normally used some newspaper at the bottom of my charcoal chimney.  It works great 90% of the time.  Except that 10% of the time when it is pretty windy outside.  Then the burning paper ash blows around and lands on my wood deck.  No bueno.  And there was no way I would consider not grilling a juicy steak just because it is windy outside.  Then I tried these fire starter cubes and they work great in the chimney too.  I put in some coals, then the fire starter, light it, then add more coals.  Works great and no paper ash blowing around.The reason I started using these fire starters was because I finally elevated myself grilling/smoking to the next level and got a Big Green Egg, and everyone who has one recommends starting your charcoal with these fire starters.  I had wanted an egg for many years, but they are expensive, and seriously, are they really even worth the extra money.  Turns out they are worth it.  On my third smoking session with the egg I cooked a packer brisket for 15 hours in single digit weather.  Without a doubt it was the best brisket I have ever cooked, and the egg holds temperature like a champ!Starting the egg with these fre starters is very easy.  I fill the fire ring with charcoal then make a small depression in the coals and place half of a fire starter in that depression.  I light the fire starter, let it burn for about 20 seconds, then push some larger chunks of charcoal over it and in minutes my egg is light and i can start adjusting the temperature.  I let the temp steady out for about ten minutes to stabilize everything and to burn off the rest of the fire starter, and then I am ready to start cooking.I highly recommend these.  I cannot believe I did not start using these years ago.","01 28, 2014",ANFJYYQ0P35CW,Chris Jaronsky,MY NEW FAVORITE FIRE STARTERS!,1390867200

Some brands dissolve too quickly, and other brands seem to sit like pebbles on the soil, week after week.  This particular blend of granules works both indoors and outdoors (I find that outdoor use requires more frequent application), and it works for both flowers and vegetables.While this is a quality product, it is a general purpose one, which means that it will fertilize a broad range of plants without being tailored specifically to a particular kind, and it is not organic.  For experienced gardeners:  the formula is 12-4-8.  For less experienced one: These numbers give the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, nutrients for plant growth.  Tomato fertilizers are generally 18-18-21, so this adds some nutrients without giving them a full-strength kick.  I find that the general purpose is best for annuals, perennials, and non-acid-loving shrubs.  (I tend to rely on more organic methods with edible herbs and vegetables.) The only thing I'm not wild about is the ""shake 'n feed"" part, something that's great to broadcast the granules outside but which can make a mess when trying to spread them into pots.If you don't have the time or the memory to fertilizer your plants using organic or water-soluble fertilizers, go with the MiracleGrow.

The stripe is much more noticeable than you would expect from the product page photo, although it's not all that hard to get used to.Unlike the cheap garden hoses that I've been using, this hose is made of ""drinking water safe"" materials, and includes a ""bacteria/mold inhibitor"" to protect the hose.  However, to keep the hose safe for drinking water, it needs to be drained when not in regular use.  As the instructions say, ""Water left in a hose for extended periods of time may result in the formation of bacteria.""This garden hose does NOT kink easily, and it's easy to coil back onto the hose holder after use.  To maximize the hose life, I always drain out some water after I turn off the spigot, because I use a ""control-top"" garden spray nozzle.  Sunlight or cold can expand the water left inside, and cause the hose to burst or leak prematurely.  The instructions recommend storing the hose indoors ""when not in use"", which I think means during the winter months.The hose has a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship ""under normal, residential, non-commercial use, for the 'Warranty Period'"".

It's only been a few days though, so I can't really comment on that, nor on the efficacy of their proprietary SPOREX formulation.What I can say is that the pressure washer (thus, just plain water) does the lion's share of the work.  I call into question their claim that pre-soaking or pre-spraying isn't necessary.  Maybe not on materials you can just hammer-down on them with the pressure washer, but for wood, etc. the product didn't seem to do much more than plain high-pressure water.  Pre-soaking might have helped, but that doesn't abide the directions on the bottle.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences.At least it doesn't smell like Montana Solvent, and is certified to be greener than the stuff I've used in the past.

B00FZJ9FXE,Patio,"[7, 9]",5,"While I respect all wildlife, there are times when the prudent human draws a line that specifies that it is best that the wildlife be on one side and humans be on the other. So it is true with pigeons, who are known to carry diseases that are very harmful to humans. They also leave a mess where they roost. In my climate pigeons tend to make their homes in areas that help to keep them out of the hot sun. I don't wish to harm them, only to discourage them from roosting in certain areas where their droppings have the potential of spreading disease or disfiguring the exterior walls of the house. In my house there are really only 2-3 such areas, one of them right over the front entrance door.Previously we had used ""chicken wire"" to prevent the pigeons from roosting in these areas.  However it is unattractive and it is possible the birds could become enmeshed in the wire, which is not the intent.During a recent whole-home remodel in which the exterior was repainted, we removed all of the chicken wire and added Bird B Gone spikes in the two areas in which pigeon droppings could potentially fall on children, guests or food.  We started with the stainless steel spikes and also wanted to compare the Lucite spikes which cost less.  This review compares the two.Despite the fact that the Lucite spikes are clear, the stainless steel spikes actually call less attention to themselves. Both have pointy ends that discourage unwanted guests from roosting but neither would be considered harmful or lethal to wildlife as they are more of a deterrent.The pro for the metal spikes is that they are shiny and wave in the wind which makes noise, all of which discourage the birds before they even get near. The downside of that is that the vibration can get a little annoying to humans in the house. For any given length they are a bit lighter than the plastic version.  Another downside is that the cost is quite a bit more.The pro for the plastic spikes is that they cost less and are equally as effective. They are very rigid and do not vibrate. But the clear material is also shiny and will most likely discourage a bird before it even comes close. I tried to break off a spike of the plastic variety and it did not break easily. Time will tell which best survives harsh weather conditions (I will update this review if I find any huge advantages of one over the other).A couple of final observations ...1. Installation with glue is much easier than installing with screws. Nobody wants to make screw holes in their roof nor glue anything to it but it's a necessary evil and let's face reality, most people will never remove bird spikes once they are installed.2. If you use glue be sure to put a dollop of glue where each screw hole is. The glue will ooze through the hole and act as a very strong screw to help hold the strip down.3. Be sure to let the spikes hang over the edge of the mounting surface 1 - 2"". This will help discourage the birds before they start to roost.4. Try mounting the strip with the spikes pointing out rather than up (this works especially well with the plastic strips). This mounting will be just as effective with almost no risk of harming the bird or catching debris.  In my installation it also makes the Lucite plastic spikes much less visible from street level.If birds are a nuisance or potential health hazard where you live, bird spikes can be a worthwhile way of telling the birds to seek shelter elsewhere without harming them. Bird B Gone seems to own the residential market for such products (although there are many, more expensive, solutions) and they are reasonably well made. They are not cheap but after all this is one of those expenses you do once and shouldn't have to think about again for many years down the road.","04 7, 2014",A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,PhotoGraphics,Very effective and humane,1396828800

However, since Amazon VINE issues a review deadline, I will comment strictly on the appearance and construction. From an appearance standpoint, the fire pit is fairly nice from a distance.  Up close , however, you can see the construction/packing/shipping flaws which give it the air of an older beat up pit.  In particular, the bowl has a major &#34;bend&#34; in the upper flat lip.

It comes with a solar panel, 2 LED lamps (high & low settings), an independent portable lantern that is quite bright on the high setting, and a power pack to charge mobile phones via a USB jack (6 adaptors included).We put the solar panel on the roof near the back of the house, the east side, where it gets lots of sunshine.  Plugging the LED lights into the control unit there is ample cord to extend the lights to the extremities of our 30 foot long deck.  We let the unit charge all of one day before trying it and it worked perfectly.  The lights lit up the deck area sufficiently to read outside if you wish, and the lantern was bright enough to light areas of the yard as we walked.However, the 2nd night we had a heavy snowfall accompanied by freezing rain and the unit put out very little power.  I suppose it is similar to all solar panels and subject to that limitation.  As the weather breaks this SHS will be moved to the back of our lot to light the storage sheds.  That is where this will be really helpful.  Lighting an area that is almost in total darkness with no streetlights around.  I will try to find a way to shelter the solar panel from heavy snow and ice during winter times, but its primary usage will be in spring, summer, and fall for yard work and home construction projects.By the way, the lantern included in this kit has several reviews on its own on Amazon.com.

B00E0CUPAE,Patio,"[0, 0]",4,"Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel is a good idea for most any home. It helps collect rain water which can then be used for other household purposes, helping to save money and conserve resources.I have used other rain barrels but this is the first one I have owned that is solid in construction. In fact, if I have to name one aspect of this rain barrel I like best, it would be the solid, sturdy design. It seems like it can stand up to the elements and withstand any type of inclement weather. Lucky for me, it doesn&#8217;t snow where I live but the durable design is good for those who live in harsher climates.With its attractive, neutral design, this rain barrel matches up well with most outdoor d&eacute;cor and I like that it has two spigots for convenience. There is also the ability to place a plant on top, as you can see in the picture. I haven&#8217;t done this and, given how shallow the space on top is, I don&#8217;t know if placing a plant here is really a good idea. If it was deeper, perhaps so, but it&#8217;s so shallow that most plants won&#8217;t fare very well.The things that bother me a little with this rain barrel are its lack of a removable top and issues with installation. There is a screen on top to help prevent debris and bugs from getting inside. And it&#8217;s a good thing the rain barrel has this because there is no way to open the top for cleaning. The best you could do is remove the small screen and try to find something narrow to stick through the small opening for cleaning. The screen will keep out leaves and other things, but if the barrel gets smelly and needs an interior cleaning job, there is little you can do.With the installation, I did have some small issues and concerns. You need to place this rain barrel directly under a downspout and because it is so tall, that will likely mean removing a large section of your downspout in order to fit the rain barrel underneath.

Probably half of the plants I have are Christmas cactus (schlumberga russelliana mostly)and while they are pretty foliage wise through out the entire year, the shorter days towards November and December cause them to flower, thereby giving these plants the common name of Christmas cactus.and they will come back every year, provided you keep them  in natural sunlight until the buds set on them. (No indirect light at night, it will mess up the blooming time.)Christmas cacti are fairly fragile when you repot them or move them, Sometimes there are loose segments that you can grow into a new plant. A good Christmas present is easy to make from the loose segments and the Take Root Rooting Hormone.Now you don't absolutely _need_ the Take Root Rooting Hormone.  You can put the little segments in a cup of water and they will take a few weeks to root providing they don't rot.  You could stick them in dirt and they will probably root if they don't dry out. Either of these strategies will take quite a few weeks to see it the segments actually do root.If you take a segment of a Christmas cactus and put the tiniest bit of the Take Root rooting hormone on the open stem and place it in dirt (and keep the dirt just a little damp), the segment will root much quicker and grow stronger than if you just use the water or dirt method. You can cut segments, dust them with the rooting hormone and quickly have a thriving pot of Christmas cacti, If you want to make sure you have tem ready for a Christmas gift, you must root them at least 6 months prior to December to ensure bloom, This  time will allow the plants to become well established.Of course, you can use the rooting hormone for any plant you want to.  I use it when transplanting plants into the garden. It helps the new plants to be established quickly.I recommend Taking Root Rooting Hormone highly to any one who has house plants or outside plants. It gives you the opportunity to increase your plants quickly at a minimum cost. And as any gardener knows, that is terrific,_enjoy_","02 15, 2014",A15LK8DSFQZZ52,"Patricia R.

Then I remembered that they had frequently let me know such, so all was well.Assembly should have been a snap. Unfortunately one of the bolts for the legs was poorly threaded. I had neither the right sized black metric bolt nor the right threading in my tap and die set to rethread the bolt or the hole. So, to put on one of the legs I had to use a bolt I had that was almost right and force it in with some thin metal stock as a shim to make the hole a little smaller. Thus a ten minute assembly took over an hour.This has a very nice appearance and, once assembled, is quite sturdy. The lid fits well enough, though it's circular shape is not quite the same as the circular shape of the bowl. I'm hesitant to put too much force on the lid to change its shape. It does contain the ashes while burning. There is also a vinyl cover for it (when not in use).The grate is sturdy enough, though I would have preferred that the spacing between its bars to have been smaller. It is difficult to use tender to get the fire started without it falling to the bottom of the bowl. I have taken a smaller grate from another grill to go crosswise and it works much better.Overall, this looks nice on the patio, burns well and I'm sure we will use it more often once the appropriate season gets here.

I feed birds in the winter, etc.  However, there are times when nuisance encroaching animals just have to go.  I prefer to live catch and relocate (rats are an exception, and I have readily resorted to poison).  I've owned and used a larger Havahart for years, having great success at trapping and relocating everything from nuisance possums, to raccoons, to poaching cats on the farm.  My early impression with this smaller trap, is that it is much easier to trap the larger varmints than the smaller ones. The smaller animals have much less body weight, and of course can maneuver in remarkably small spaces, and their survival instincts lead them to be quite inventive.I took this offer for the Havahart 1061 from Amazon to specifically try to thin out  the gray squirrel traffic here at my in-town home.  The grays are much smaller than the larger red squirrels and I thought I'd try this small trap.Features on this trap are Two-Door access (one on each end),  the &#34;Easy Set&#34; system, 17.25&#34; length, 5&#34;x5&#34; opening.  I don't know how to account for some the of the bad experiences in the other reviews, but setting the trap that I received is a breeze!  Simply rotate the setting handle back, and the cable system sets the trap nicely.The 5&#34;x5&#34; opening sounded awfully small, but when finally viewing live, I knew it would be just right for my gray squirrels.  And it is.  Two catches already using peanuts, and also a catch and release small bunny (they are relatively few here and not a problem for me).  I took the squirrels to a nearby lake/park location where there are plentiful walnut trees (yum!).  I have had  a couple incidences of finding an empty tripped trap . . . maybe an escape, but more likely tripped from an outside disturbance . . . this trap is sensitive!  I've also had a couple incidences of stolen bait . . . on that I suspect the local blue jays, which have displayed a vigorous taste for peanuts (I had tossed peanuts out, no trap, for several days in advance to &#34;bait the area&#34;).  I suppose a blue jay is also capable of being caught in this thing - maybe so far they've stayed off of the tripping platform.I will definitely keep this trap on hand for any future mice or (forbid) another rat.  No subject nuisance mice targets yet, so I'll have to take Havahart's word that it works on mice.  The mesh is small, but so are mice.  And the tripping mechanism is sensitive, but mice don't weigh much.  We'll see. I DO like the notion of using this for mice, rather than the traditional wooden neck breaker mouse traps I have used in the past on mice (mice seem nice, but just don't want them in my home).In all, great trap, typical from Havahart:  Sturdy, easy to set, sensitive, and not injurious to animals (notwithstanding the trauma of being caught in the trap . . . so please monitor a set trap often and relocate and release immediately).","05 4, 2014",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,T.M.

Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help. In my opinion, traps are effective if they are placed just so (I've had little luck with them), but bait and mole-killer &#34;worms&#34; work best.","05 15, 2014",A10H24TDLK2VDP,William Jens Jensen,Handy tool for the infested yard,1400112000

We thought this would be a great product to try being new to the hot tub / spa world as we learn our chemical balance needed for the spa. We figured this would be a quick and easy way to get rid of any foam we saw.First - It does work, yes your foam will disappear within moments. So if you needed a &#34;quick fix' maybe this is for you? Personally we don't like it. We never had a scum line and the following week one was present - But the product says it helps that? That same week our water was cloudy and a little odor to it for the first time ever. We did try it again as directly and added chlorine as needed but noticed our PH was off to. We had the same issue, actually that week had even more foam! Yes it did all go away when the product was added- but we rather not have an odor cloudy scum line spa at its costs.We find that as long as the PH is correct (simply a PH up we use) their is no foam, no scum line, water clear and not smelly.

B00HH4K8E0,Patio,"[3, 5]",2,"**** See update below for why I knocked it down to 2 stars.  Original review is here: ****I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004. It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and ""upgraded"" to the MM1800, the 18"" corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick (the motor blew out and smoked).  I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B&D; Mower.For mowing my own lawn, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I didn't want to deal with battery management.  Cords are a fine option, but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said, B&D; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower, and for the first time in my adult mowing life, I think I might be back to both B&D; (and using battery operation).Opening the box, I found the mower in 3 pieces.  The battery was pre-installed (with half-charge), so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle.  The handle attaches in 2 parts.  You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in, but once installed, they loosen with a simple lever.  This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage.  I have had ""easy fold"" handles before, but this one is actually easy.  The mower is very light, and with a handle on top of the body of the mower, I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space.  I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B&D; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries.  It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries, but gives no indication of the performance difference.  This could be important because the 36V batteries are $80 and the 40V are $110.  So understand that you are getting over $200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies.  The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad.  You also get a really nice charger which has ""smarts"" to let you know when a battery is charged.  Each battery also has a ""power gauge"" to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow?  I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season.  Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts.  I plugged in the safety key (great feature to keep your mower off when you aren't around - it appears to be ""smart"" and won't let you just short out the terminals).  I also decided not to bag initially.  The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck.  I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower (no surprise - the grass was tall and wet).  Most impressively, the mower stopped on tall grass and didn't burn out like my older corded mowers did.  It appears to know not to destroy itself.  You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going, a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor.  I set it higher (to 6) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance, I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other.  Each worked for about 20 minutes (not quite the 30 advertised).  The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead, so no period of ""weak mowing"" when you're not sure if you should replace it.  When it's dead, it's dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you don't need to fight to keep it open like other bags.  It can't hold much, so you'll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires.  Unfortunately they are plastic (not rubber or real tires), but they seem to get the job done.  The mower is a total of about 17"" wide, so it will fit into very tight space, but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall, I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management.  If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you don't want to mess with power cords, this mower is certainly a fine choice.  All of that being said, be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower (like the Greenworks 25022) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower.  It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord?  If the answer is ""yes"", then you will be quite happy with this B&D; Mower.**** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today.  While mowing, I hit a few rocks which is common around here (very rocky soil).  My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks, but it's been going strong for years with the dings.  However, the small ding knocked the B&D; CM1640 totally out of balance.  It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed.  I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse.  These weren't giant rocks mind you, but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers.  As I pushed on, the mower caught a root and it was all over.  The blade literally bent 90 degrees (see photo I uploaded).  It is now trash.  Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks, and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots?  Both are possible, but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up.  I have hit quartz, granite, and just about everything else in my yard, and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened?  I have a theory - it's a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible.  Looking at the blade, it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current.  The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries cannot be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot.  The charger won't charge them.  So you can't recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2.  Another issue!I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower.  Once again I left it outside, under my deck, all winter, and it finished up my yard for me today great.

B00BBQVL5U,Patio,"[1, 1]",5,"Purchasing this Greenworks mower was a leap of faith for me.  I have a very large (~10,000 sf)  and somewhat hilly lawn, and for the past 15 years I've used a big, twin-bladed, 33"" cutting path, 10.5 hp, self-propelled, four-speed, semi-pro Craftsman lawnmower.  It was fast (I could do the whole yard in 40 minutes), but it was loud and required all the usual small-engine maintenance.I just mowed the lawn for the first time using the Greenworks battery-powered mower and I couldn't be happier.  I expected it to take much longer, because of the narrower cutting path, but it went faster than I expected because the mower is so light and maneuverable that I wasted less time doing turns.  I was worried about it not being self-propelled, but again the light weight of the mower really made a difference.  It was more of a workout that walking behind the Craftsman self-propelled mower, but not bad at all.  I'd liken it to pushing a high-wheeled stroller with an infant on board.On this first pass, I took off the bag and used the mower in mulching mode.  It worked very effectively, including on the occasional pine cone.  My grass is mostly fescue, which is fairly thin, and the mower cut it easily and evenly.  In a couple of thicker patches the electric engine rev'd up automatically and handled the denser turf just fine.Starting the mower is very simple -- push one button and pull back the lever.  Much more convenient than starting my old lawnmower with its pull cord.  One delightful (and unexpected) advantage is that the mower is much quieter than my old gas mower.  I always used to wear ear protection when mowing, but didn't need to with this electric mower.  My family reported that it was also much, much quieter inside the house.One thing I'm looking forward to is the lack of maintenance and not having to prep the mower for winter storage, or change the oil, or store gas.I can charge the batteries from our solar panels, which makes this a very green solution.  I was surprised to learn recently that small gas-powered engines in lawn equipment are very dirty compared to modern cars, so this small change of mower makes a big difference in terms of my environmental footprint.The mower comes with two batteries, a 4ah and 2 ah.  Both can be installed at the same time, and the mower automatically switches to the second battery when the first runs out.  Unfortunately, the combination was not quite enough to finish my lawn.  Two 4ah batteries would be sufficient, and I wish this option were available when purchasing the mower.  A second 4ah battery is pretty expensive, but because Greenworks prices its bundles (i.e., piece of equipment together with a battery and charger) pretty aggressively relative to the cost of batteries alone, you can get a spare battery at fairly low marginal cost if you buy multiple Greenworks products.  As it turned out, I also wanted a cordless electric leafblower, so I ordered a Greenworks leafblower plus battery and I now have three interchangeable batteries, which is more than enough for my lawn.Bottom line:  This mower cuts smoothly and evenly, mulches well, does an average to large lawn on one charge, is light enough to push without needing to be self propelled, is much quieter than a gas mower, needs less maintenance than gas-powered small engines, and is seriously green (especially if you have solar panels like we do).  For me, it makes mowing a lot more fun (or at least a lot less of a chore).  Two thumbs up.Update May 5:  I ordered this mower through Amazon.  I ordered some additional items directly from Greenworks website.  One of the packages arrived, but another got lost in transit.  I emailed Greenworks over the weekend and received a reply first thing this morning that they would ship a replacement today.  Couldn't ask for a faster or more complete resolution.  So, in addition to really liking the product, I'm also impressed by the responsiveness of their customer service.

I have the best results when I use cutting from new growth early in the season.For good results you should have very clean cutting tools (sterilized with bleach or rubbing alcohol), fresh perlite or a &#34;light&#34; potting soil & a sterilized container.I cut a bunch of fresh growth woody stems then I take them back to my work area and I cut them to about 8&#34; long near a &#34;node&#34;, remove all the leaves but one, make sure the cut end is cut at an angle, wet the stems & then dip them in the rooting compound & then push into the perlite or potting soil.  You can put them very close together - 1&#34; or so apart.  I always cut several more than I need because they won't all survive.  If you get lucky & they all grow, you'll have plants to share.Keep out of sunlight & keep moist but not too wet or they will rot.  It may take a couple weeks (depends on the plant) but I check them by VERY gently pulling on a stem to see if roots are growing.  If there is a bit of tension when you pull, you probably have roots.  Try not to pull them all the way out or you'll break the tender growth.The cuttings usually spend a couple months in the pot & then I separate them & plant them in 4-6&#34; pots.  You could even plant them in the ground in a very protected area where you can keep watch over them for another season.  I sometimes put them in a small corner in my garden so they can grow undisturbed until they are big enough to move.It all depends on the type of plant you are propagating.  If it's an easy woody plant to grow, it will probably be easy to root from cuttings.

The grills heat evenly and provide great results.I have only had propane Webers before. So I was very intrigued about how an electric grill would work and the results. Well the results are fantastic. The body is very well engineered. It provides a nice seal which essentially makes the grill a convection oven. The taste is very 'clean'. but you still get grill flavor. But your seasoning and the nice quick sear is what is giving you flavor. There is no slight gas flavor, which is a plus to me.Steaks have come out heavenly. But bone-in chicken, wow. Moist, crisp, tender, juicy. I put it perhaps a little past medium high as recommended for the chicken but it came out great. The steaks were on high and so juicy.There are a couple of limitations to be aware of. There is a suggested 20 minute warm up time before you put food down. I have followed this. Certainly for steaks on high you want the grill to be nice and warm. But you should be aware of that before ordering if that is a concern. Second there is 'only' a 6 foot cord and they suggest you don't use an extension cord. This is a problem for us and I would suspect for others. We can reach an outlet from a table, but it is stretched across off the ground. Not good if you have little kids. Of course if you buy a cart this is not a problem.One other small suggestion. Put the handle on before you attach the cover in back to the main body. It was awkward to attach the handle after the top was connected. But overall very little assembly.Even with the small issues this was easily a 5. I am finding myself not wanting to use my other grills. If you are in a situation without having access to propane or charcoal, bam this guy will have you grilling as well as anyone else.

The combination provides an immediate boost, plus a long tail.Application - The package says that a single application lasts up to three months.  This 4-1/2 pound package will feed roughly 135 sq. ft. if you're using it in a flower bed.Composition - Nitrogen - 9%; Phosphate - 19%; Potash - 9%; Sulfur - 20%  Some (6%-12.5%-6%) of the Nitrogen, Phosphate and Potash has a polymer coating to allow for slow-release.  Note that this formulation, unlike it's all-purpose brethren, does not have any trace minerals.  It also has a substantially higher sulfur content, which helps to lower your soil pH.Usage - I live in California, in an area with a long growing season.  In Spring, I'll first apply Miracle-Gro All-Purpose plant food (also in the Shake'n Feed container).  That formula has a higher nitrogen content to help plants get growing.

As someone with not particularly strong hands or wrists, I really appreciate the design of the hose coupler.  It is easy to grasp and I could turn it tightly enough not to leak without using pliers.  A big thank you to whoever came up with this design.  Another welcome feature is that the hose curls the way I want it to.  I keep it in a large pot, so I want a larger circle of hose and not the tight ring it came in.  It was so easy to place it neatly in the pot, and it willingly goes back into the new, looser curl.  The hose it replaced wanted to curl tightly, even after years of use, so it was always tangled.  I have four garden hoses, and this is by far my favorite.

They tend to feed one at a time; if a second one shows up, they chase each other around until one leaves (for the time being).  The six feeding flowers may help hummingbirds find the food, but aren't used simultaneously by our birds.It is well made of sturdy plastic; the jar is especially thick clear plastic.  The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the ""nectar,"" we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.  This fills it about 1/3 way, which lasts several days even with lots of bird activity.  I don't want to let it go more than a few days between refills to ensure the solution doesn't spoil.  So really, something with less capacity would work just fine.  It doesn't leak (except for spillage when the wind blows it around), and the hummingbirds noticed it and began feeding within a few hours of putting it up.  The base has plenty of color to attract birds, so no need for red solution.Taking down the feeder for cleaning and refilling would be easier with a small clip.  We tied ours to a string and have to either work the top out of the wire hanger, or unscrew it and leave the top hanging, making it harder to reattach when full.  A clip would make this much easier.  Also be sure to let the solution cool completely before filling, and rinse off the perches when cleaning and refilling to encourage perching.We hung ours a few feet outside a picture window, and the hummingbirds don't seem to mind at all when we are nearby.  Perhaps they have gotten used to humans.  We can stand quietly just under the hanging feeder and they come in to feed without seeming to notice us.","06 4, 2014",A3IMK08UX0I46A,"TOPJOB7 ""topjob7""",Oversized and sturdy - twist flowers to stop leaks!,1401840000

Too dry, aerating tubes can't punch through and the cutting edges are dulled. The solid needs to be just damp enough for the aerating tubes to punch through and cleanly push out the plugs.*The old Hound Dog aerator just has an unbreakable U-shaped handle, unlike the Yard Butler aerator which has a welded T-handle.  I'm extra careful not to push down on the handle, and just lift the handle gently during removal from the soil.*Some damp plugs will get stuck occasionally, just push it out by stepping on some slightly damp soil.  I wouldn't use a screwdriver to pry out the plugs because that may roughen up the inner surfaces of the aerating tubes and cause more plugs to get stuck.*Just get a tube or stick that's slightly smaller in diameter than the aerating tubes and punch out the stuck plugs.*Be careful not to bend or distort the cutting edges will lead to more stuck plugs.Overall:Good for treating sections of troubled, brown, dried lawn.

While I'm generally comfortable working with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers, I welcome knowledgeable advice. That's why I was eager to put this helpful Parrot to work.I'll focus here on showing how the Parrot works out of the box and what it's like tapping into the specific data you gather and augmenting your knowledge with the plant library the app provides. Thus far, the unit and app both seem to be working well (including the day I let my plant dry out to see whether that would trigger a ""water me"" alert, which it did).Since I ""drive"" the Parrot with my phone, I was able to snap some screen shots for you. I've placed them, with annotations, in the customer images section on the product page.  These shots include live-action shots and historical data. The app archives data so that you can review in daily, weekly, and monthly view.  The Parrot unit gathers and stores data and transmits it via Bluetooth. The Flower Power app communicates with the ""Parrot Cloud"" by way of 3G, 4G or wifi.Setup is simple, but remind yourself that it takes at least 24 hours for the Parrot to generate its first report. In the meantime, you can dig into the Flower Power database, and start building your ""garden,"" by selecting other plants with which you will want to work. Each time your search nets a result, you can add that plant to your garden. You can personalize entries by taking photos of your plants, or use the images provided in the database. You have access to 6,000 plants.Be sure that the Flower Power app recognizes your physical location; this simple but necessary step helps with future use. Indeed, during initial use, I received notification that an update for my location (Hawaii) was available; depending on your location, you may receive a similar prompt.Speaking of locations, I am in Zone 10, which isn't ideal for some of the plants I would like to grow. However, I've checked through the app and located support for several flowers I plan to grow this year, including particular varieties of crocus and tulips. In years past, I've had varying results with these plants, so I hope that the Parrot will mean a better outcome this year.In order to make best use of the app, I would need to have multiple Parrot units. The workaround I've been using is to move the Parrot from one plant to the next on a weekly basis. In several more months, I will evaluate the overall benefit of the Parrot unit and the Flower Power database, and decide whether to buy additional units.If you have questions about the unit or the app, please post in the comments, and I will respond as soon as possible.","02 20, 2014",A3KGLXW3EYDTUH,"ck ""moonshadow""",Parrot on Patrol,1392854400

B00AQ4BW52,Patio,"[0, 2]",3,"I actually already own thePerky-Pet 2-in-1 Wild Bird Feederwhich didn't fare the elements too well last year as the copper finish not only began to tarnish quickly, but one of the ports actually corroded completely away during storage in our shed over the winter.So, when this Perky-Pet Seed Bunker feeder showed up, I was very pleased to see that for only a slightly elevated cost, the material on this feeder is of much sturdier quality.  This means that the feeder is pretty heavy and the metal is extraordinarily durable.  In fact, a number of the hoods and perches came knocked out of place during shipping.  (Amazon's usually amazing service for some reason did a lousy job with packing this item for shipment.)  But the perches and hoods were not damaged or bent despite what was probably a turbulent journey and they were easily snapped back into place.  I've only had it for a month, but my guess is that the quality material will probably fare a lot better and longer than my other bird feeder which is mostly made of thin plastic.For what it is primarily designed to do, it does it just fine.  It's easy to fill with bird seed and it attracted a variety of beautiful birds the very first day.However, it is not squirrel proof.I actually filled both feeders and suspended this one from a tree using ametal hookand the other from ashepherd's hook.  I noticed the very first day that half the seed was gone, very quickly.  Suspicious that a squirrel was getting into them, I swapped the two feeders, thinking that perhaps the lack of a plate on the bottom of this Seed Bunker feeder would make it harder for the squirrel to get a grip onto the feeder from the shepherd's hook.  A few hours later, I saw that much of the seed was gone already.  And then an hour after that, I caught the culprit in the act.  The squirrel was able to climb right up the shepherd's crook and then held himself upside down while raiding the Seed Bunker.  It did the exact same thing with the other bird feeder by climbing the tree and scooting himself upside down the metal hook.  At this point, I'm pretty convinced that very little will deter squirrels from the bird feeders, not even those fancy ones which have thecollapsible perches(designed to collapse at the heavy weight of a squirrel, but not a bird) since the squirrel made no use of the perches at all when he was lowering himself onto the feeders from above.It should be noted that Perky Pet does market a number of wild bird feeders that are specifically targeted for problem squirrelshere,here, andhereamong several others, but even those are of limited effectiveness against a determined squirrel.  (Which is what we've got.  Those little buggers have completely chewed through several thick plastic trash can lids of ours.)  Squirrels can chew through plastic parts of so-called squirrel-proof bird feeders.  And even if the feeder is completely made of metal (which this Seed Bunker feeder is not, as the viewing windows are very thin plastic), the squirrels can learn to shake the feeder and spill the seed onto the ground.  There are a fewfeedersthat seem to fare better at warding off squirrels than the ones from Perky-Pet, but they tend to be inthe next price range upand still not 100% effective for everyone.Our current hope, since we don't contemplate spending more money on bird feeders, is that greasing the pole and hook with ample amounts of vaseline will keep the squirrels away and perhaps make for some funny videos if we see them slipping off.  We will see if that does the trick and I'll come back here and update.  I guess, meanwhile, the silver lining in all this is that now that the squirrels have all this bird seed, they're sorta leaving my trash cans alone.  The other silver lining is that my kids have a good reason to scream ""Those Darn Squirrels!"" whenever they see the thieves raiding the feeders.If you found this review helpful or if you have any questions, please let me know.

It's the most attractive, with a glass cylinder and a copper finish on the metal cap and the plastic base surround, with metal flowers surrounding the ports that are protected by what the company identifies as bee guards. We haven't hit the time of year when bees are a problem around our hummingbird feeders, so I can't attest to their effectiveness.The glass cylinder is quite narrow, so it will be difficult to clean without a bottle brush. I also suggest getting a small brush to clean the ports, as they are deep enough that you really want to make sure that they get clean. The base comes apart, so it's easy to clean, but the metal flowers will slow you down a little. It's worth it, though, since they add to the attractiveness of the feeder. I didn't have any trouble with leaking, which was reported in some other reviews.The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder the best as well. Of the three feeders (all cylinder-style), they have been most attracted to this feeder. They do seem to have some problem perching and eating at the same time. It's possible that the bee guards are impeding their ability to get to the juice while sitting on the perches, as they usually hover while feeding.As with the 30-ounce feeder, this feeder came with a packet of nectar concentrate. I recommend tossing it in the garbage, and make a fresh batch of nectar by using four parts boiled water to one part sugar. The packet contains red dye, which the company states is harmless to the birds, but it's not necessary to attract them, so why take the chance?This is a very attractive feeder and would make a great gift. While they are not nearly as attractive, I still prefer the dish-style feeders, like the Aspects Hummzinger feeders that are available here, and the similar Wild Birds Unlimited-branded feeders, but this is pretty good as well.","06 12, 2014",AVBLGXSWRN666,S.

I asked him what he thinks now, and he said, ""Oh, my god, I love it!  You just have to get used to how you have to use it.  We should have gotten one of these years ago.""  And despite our initial impressions, this is now his go-to hose when he's using a sprinkler.  He's also really happy that you can adjust the spray to high pressure without needing an attachment (a feature he didn't think he needed at first but now regularly uses).Here's my original review:This hose will NOT replace all hose needs.  If you need a very lightweight hose for, say, watering planters near the faucet, this will work.  But that's about all it's good for.Pros:*It's shockingly light.*It does retract (sort of).Cons:*You will not get anywhere near a 50-foot reach with this thing.  30 is more like it.*The flow is VERY low.*It's impractical to use with any attachment (sprinkler, for example) because the end of the hose (and the attachment) whips around when you turn off the water.*Speaking of whipping around, make sure there are no kids, pets, plants, or anything breakable in the way of this hose or near the end when you turn off the faucet.  The hose is gonna whip 'em.*The hose doesn't seem very sturdy or durable.However, if you really want and/or need a lightweight hose, as long as you know what you are in for with this type of product, this is probably among the better ones.

If this is your first rain barrel, consider placing it convenient to plants that are not easily reached by an existing spigot. Convenience means that you are less likely to neglect watering your plants. And if you are in a climate that gets low temperatures, don't forget to drain your barrel as winter approaches.

This one definitely has more capacity than any other commercially available hummingbird feeder, which means trips to remove, clean and refill the feeder are less frequent. The feeder does not come fully assembled and it's a bit of a struggle to snap in those yellow floral discs... and because of the opening there is big (a huge invite for wasps, etc.) without the yellow disc, it's not an optional add-on - you've got to snap that sucker in there... it just makes it more complex to take apart to clean. I make my own feeder mixture of 5:1 water to sugar ratio as the birds do not need red dye - the red on the feeder is enough to attract them. I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder. The central reservoir is plastic - likely because glass would make it too heavy - but I am not impressed with the quality of the plastic grooves you use to turn/lock this into place. Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir. I do not see this lasting through an abundant number of refills - because those plastic tabs get shaved each time you screw and unscrew the bottom from the reservoir - eventually, it simply will not have the friction to stay together when too much material is lost. I know they're calling this &#34;The Grand Master&#34; because of the capacity - but I'd much rather see a higher-quality one - glass reservoir with a metal bottom and baked enamel paint instead of this weak plastic that quickly wears.

Keeping in mind that I'm not a BBQ expert (and I've never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It's a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there's no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I'll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &#34;sharp end&#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn't quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I'll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats.

The 3200 model is the premier model in the line of 5 Q series grills, with all the others being a &#34;Tabletop&#34; version. The 3200 is similar to the 2000 versions however it comes with a stand. At first I was a little disappointed that this was plastic. Being used to the build quality of the Genesis series I was surprised.... however it quickly became apparent that my concerns were not warranted and this is a smart design choice by Weber. The use of a heavy duty plastic results in a dramatic reduction in weight without a loss of it feeling solid. I was able to put the unit together in under an hour without any assistance. The documentation is clear and the instructions guided me through to completion without issue. The grill is well designed, as with all Weber grills I have owned or used, the attention to detail shows the quality of this grill. The built in handle light is a nice addition which I had purchased for the genesis, this comes included with the 3200. The side tables fold down and click back together with a substantial lock. The design of the grill plate is clever, the cast porcelain coated plates actually incorporate a flavorizer bar just below the grill bars allowing for a much more compact unit without sacrificing the key functions of the bigger grills in the Weber family.The lid is aluminum coated to reduce the weight of the unit, which can easily be lifted by two people without any strain (one could do it in a pinch). I was able to roll this around with one hand. Ideal for throwing on a truck for tailgating before the game and with the tables folding down the footprint for transporting is not too big. Weber's standard drip tray is also incorporated with the unit meaning standard parts can be purchased for use. There is incorporated holder for the propane tank - electric ignition and dual burners - one outside ring and a central burner from left to right this allows for configuration of indirect heat if required.Again you are getting Weber's quality and from my understanding their warranty service is outstanding - I have never had to utilize it though, their products have served me that well in the past.

B004XWTSGS,Patio,"[1, 1]",5,"I have used Tomcat bait stations before, and the bait has effectively killed the mouse (and rat---with a different Tomcat product) problem. This bag contained one refillable bait station and 8 baits. The station was wrapped in plastic while the baits were unwrapped and so freely moved around inside the bag. It would have made more sense to bundle the baits together in plastic-wrap. As it was, some of the baits had chipped corners and other minor damage. Plus you have to touch (with gloves) a poison-coated plastic wrap to unwrap the station. Just a ""what were they thinking"" comment. You have to touch the bait (with gloves) to load the station, anyway, so it's not a big deal.The station is not difficult to load, though it does require human fingers. The station is CHILD and DOG resistant to tampering. The plastic bait station is sturdy-looking. The bait is not easily accessible unless you're a mouse, break the trap, or know how to open the station for refilling. Crumbs of nibbled bait could fall out if ""rattled"" for a bit, though. I don't put poison traps anywhere a pet or child could easily get at them (or the dead mice), but these traps probably would slow children or dogs down long enough for someone to notice and stop them before the bait was touched.You can view the state of the bait (nibbled? gone?) through the clear plastic top so you know when to add a new bait or if you should try a new location. The traps are weather-resistant and can be used INDOORS and OUTDOORS. I've left mine outside fully exposed to the heavy rains we've been having the last few days, and so far the bait is still dry. It's also shown signs of some nibbling. There is a tunnel that protects the station's entrance from rain. The traps are 4.25"" x 4.25"" x 1.25"".

Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.  This is a lightweight yard tool - the batteries are small and it really feels under-powered to me, but I am used to using a 36volt li-ion trimmer that can go thru absolutely anything i throw it at.  For the first edging of the season, you'll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren't going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn't get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.  I had to wait for my husband to get home and get him to do it.  Big fail.  Why should it  be so difficult to put together that I have to ask my husband for help?Once you get past that difficulty, the rest of this product is dead simple to use and nice and lightweight.

So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower, which is zero maintenance; but dealing with a 100' cord is a real hassle.  So, when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower, I had high hopes, especially since I've been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup.  It's lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating.  The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool, so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower, simply because its so simple and convenient.  It takes three seconds (literally) to grab a battery off the shelf, snap it into the blower, and get to work.The only downside of the blower (which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes.  My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery, so I was expecting better battery life.  The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups, but it means this leafblower won't be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup, when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line:  I really like this blower for weekly cleanup.  It's lightweight, powerful, and super convenient.  It starts instantly and creates no fumes, so I tend to use it a lot more often.  It won't do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall, but it's a great yard tool, especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools, since the batteries are fully interchangeable.  (Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools.  The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge.

Cleaning requires unscrewing the top and bottom from a clear glass tube and hand washing with warm soapy water twice a week.  Then screw the feeder base with bee guards onto the glass tube, add up to 12 oz/355 ml nectar, screw the top on, and hang the feeder in an easily visible area.The Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder is the first feeder I've owned or attempted to use.  After a month, I've yet to see a hummingbird and the nectar level hasn't changed.  A week in and I started to wonder what I was doing wrong.  Between Perky Pet's companion website and some advice from friends, I learned that hummingbirds are territorial, have poor eyesight, and are attracted to bright red and orange colors.  Perky Pet's interactive hummingbird migration map also verified sightings in my area.  After learning this, I started looking at plants for the yard which might help attract hummingbirds and relocated the feeder from a secluded area off the back porch to a more visible spot outside my kitchen window.Even though I've yet to feed a hummingbird, I can't blame the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.

Here in Arizona, hoses usually rot within a year or two (the intense heat and sun kills them), but I am cautiously optimistic about this one.  It works great - I can pick it up, extend to the areas I need to water, and then it all very neatly and tightly coils back together near my spigot.  I think the straight ends are KEY as the other coil hoses I've had didn't have this.  As some of the other reviewers noted, you cannot cover anywhere near 50' of distance with this hose due to the coils and the inability to stretch the hose out flat.  Mine works optimally in a 15-25' range and after that I need to hold one side of it with tension to allow the hose to stretch more, maybe to around 35' of range.  I'm very careful not to stretch the coils more than they are intended because when you do that, they can reverse on themselves and it makes untangling the hose a nightmare.  I'll update this review when the hose fails so if there's no additional note, it's still going strong!UPDATE:  4 months in and this hose is still going strong.

B0030BG1JU,Patio,"[1, 1]",4,"While I have not had this snowblower very long, I have already put it to its first test recently, which is what this review will be based on. In about 4"" of snow, the snowblower did well. It got right down to the asphalt in my driveway, and concrete sidewalk. It's not nearly as loud as my neighbor's Toro snow shovel, so I don't imagine that I annoyed anyone using this in the morning, either. Installation was a piece of cake, and I used Loctite Blue on some of the screws, after reading previous reviews, so that I didn't have any issues with anything coming loose. On top of that, I used WD40 inside the deck, on the auger, and inside the shoot (you MUST let it dry first) - that, too, worked very well.I really only have two issues with this snowblower, and one of them plagues ALL electric snowblowers. First, cable management sucks. This is not a knock on this snowblower, but on all of them. Dragging around a 15lb., 100' 12/3 cable can be a real PITA, and does make clearing snow take a little longer. Still beats the hell out of shoveling, though. Secondly, the chute doesn't always stay where you aim it. I had to turn it a few times after the snow started hitting it so hard that it would spin and throw snow in a different direction. This is the only reason I'm giving this snowblower 4 stars instead of 5, and for the price that I paid, I may even be a little harsh in doing so. I'll likely come up with some solution to both issues, but the second one really should come from the factory.I'll likely update this review once we get more snow to see how things go, but once you get the hang of how you're going to attack your snow removal, things become easier (i.e., cable management). It's easy to see why this is the #1 rated electric snowblower on Amazon.-----------------------------------------------Update: 2/4/14-----------------------------------------------Our area was hit with 10-12"" of some of the heaviest, wettest snow I've ever dealt with, so I figured this was a great test for the snowblower. The snowblower handled most of the snow very well, and the only real time I had some issues, where I had to go over the same spot twice, was where my wife had previously driven over the snow and compacted it down. Still, I was able to clear everything down to the asphalt without much physical effort.I am still very impressed by how well this is handling a wide range of snow types. For those complaining about the snowblower not throwing the snow very far, that's going to happen if you're only trying to remove 2-3"" of snow. The more snow you go through, the farther it's going to be thrown. This happens to all snowblowers, regardless of their powertrain (happened on our old neighborhood's $3k Honda, too).The chute issue does add some time to snow removal, since I have to constantly adjust it. I tried using a long velcro tie to keep it locked, but it was difficult to do quickly while wearing winter gloves. I'm not sure why I didn't think of it sooner, but I'm going to try using a very short bungee tie to keep it in place. If you attach it just below the chute handle before the rod bend, and attach to the side handlebars, it will keep the chute in place. A minor inconvenience, IMO, given that this steal beats the tar out of shoveling. You can see the location I'm referring to by checking out the image I uploaded to the ""Customer Images"" section of this product.","01 27, 2014",A1H8UMB0BB6SGC,Nick Panaccio,Proving to be a worthwhile investment,1390780800

B000ZOPXPS,Patio,"[1, 1]",3,"I have 75 feet of 5/8"" hose on this reel now and probably could get another 25 feet on there if it were carefully rolled but I would say that 100 feet is the maximum capacity for standard 5/8"" hose.Assembly was easy enough with the exception of the wheels. They provide nylon lined lock nuts and they are very difficult to turn. You will need a 15/16"" wrench, make that two wrenches because you need to use so much force to thread the nylon lining you have to hold on to the bolt as you twist the nut. Other than that it went smoothly and the tires came inflated.The water supply hose provided is low quality 5/8"" hose and a washer was not included for the end that connects to the hose reel. Fortunately I keep some on hand and did use a washer for that connection.The fitting on the reel the supply hose attaches to was screwed on so tight I had to use a wrench to back it off enough to attach the hose.The hose unwinds and winds easily and the unit is easy to move around. So far no leaks at the connectors.At 30 days I already have a couple spots of rust forming. The paint does not seem like a high quality baked on enamel and the U shaped piece in front of the wheels does not have any type of feet so the metal makes direct contact with the ground. It will likely get scratched up and be another source of rusting.The real test of a hose reel is how it is holding up after a season or two.  I am required to post a review within 30 days so I can only give first impressions and will follow up the review when I have had more time with it. My initial impression is this reel will last about as long as a good quality plastic hose reel (3 years) but it is twice the cost.In comparison; June 2004 I purchased a Rapid Reel two-wheeled all metal hose cart and it is still in service today. No rust, no parts have needed replacing and it came with a high quality 3/4"" water supply hose. It has survived 9 Minnesota winters outside; I just disconnect the hoses and drain the water out.

B00G8R2JWG,Patio,"[1, 2]",3,"I'm sorry, I'm a nice guy and I don't like to trash anyone products or ideas, but this feeder, while cute and fairly well made, has a lot of issue that prevent it from being a truly useful feeder. But read on because I also found a good use for it.First, let me tell you how to prevent squirrels in your feeders 100-percent of the time. I've been feeding birds for decades (I'm not going to say how many decades, lol) and while I have tons of gray squirrels on my property, none of them get to my feeders unless I want them to get there (and I do allow them to get to one of my tray feeders, particularly in cold winters). Squirrels can only jump approximately four vertical feet and a little more than that horizontally. So, if you go to a bird-feeder/wildlife supplies store, or your local home store, and buy a say, 8' of metal piping and plant it in the ground (bird feeder stores, if you have one nearby, have a cool tool for this that makes the job ultra easy), you can place a baffle on the pipe just over four feet off the ground and the squirrels will *not* get past it. Then you can put a double or triple shepherd's hook at the top and hang several feeders. I have a 2' x 2' open tray feeder on another pole filled to the brim and no squirrel has ever feasted there. So what you need is a pole, a baffle and some kind of hooks at the top for hanging feeders: all of this is available in a bird-feeding store (I won't mention the chain name here because Amazon will take it out--but it has ""wild"" in the name). (Squirrels *can* jump downward amazing heights, by the way, so you must be careful not to be under a tree limb--I've seen squirrels drop 20 feet vertically.)As far as this feeder goes. First of all, the dome is great for keeping the birds and seed a bit dryer, but it's not going to deter any squirrels. Five mins after the first squirrel got onto this feeder (and I hung it under a tree limb so that he could get there), he hung by his back paws from the loop and swung himself down. Mission accomplished.Also, the description says this hold 3.5 lbs of seed--hah, in someone's dreams. This hardly holds anything. A half pound if you're lucky. The feeder tray is only 9.5-inches across and less than an inch deep.OK, all of that said, there are uses for this feeder and, as I said, it's a cute feeder, pretty nicely made. As at least one other reviewer stated this make a good thistle (niger) feeder--excellent, in fact (some seed does drip out the drain holes, but that can't be avoided). But small finches do have trouble getting their beaks through the grating, so I removed it. I just fill the tray with thistle and they sit on the edge and it works just fine.In it's own way, I kind of find the feeder useful, now the goldfinches have their own little feeder and since squirrels don't like that type of seed, the barely pay it any mind. This feeder is not what it says it is, it's not a squirrel warrior, but it's kind of pretty and I'm sure you can find uses for it. Ironically, if you took off the dome and got rid of the grid, you could fill it with peanuts and feed the squirrels. Or, if you have fruit-eating birds like Baltimore Orioles, you can place orange sections in it. Nothing beats seeing an Oriole at the feeder! If you want to buy the best bird feeders around, look at Droll Yankee. I've probably spent a thousand dollars on feeders over the years and theirs last forever.","04 5, 2014",A1O97WKID9L3IA,"Jeff Wignall ""Photographer, Author and Radio ...",It is not going to keep squirrels out but could be adapted for other uses,1396656000

But the Yard Butler hose cart was a challenge. It does not have a lot of parts but there are NO instructions, just drawings, which are no help and are even numbered incorrectly should you decide to follow them.The first step is to attach the tires using a very large bolt and lock nuts. Simple, except that I could not tighten the lock nuts and wasn't sure how far in to tighten them even if I could. Leaving them at the point where they reached the plastic resulted in too much wobble. So I had to wait for my husband who is much stronger than me, had the correct, large wrench in his mechanic's toolbox, and knew just how much to tighten the bolts. And it required quite a bit of force to do so.Once we got the wheels installed it was easy going to attach the reel and the handle using a screwdriver. Next problem, the cart didn't roll very well. This is because the pneumatic tires had to be inflated. I think plastic tires would be just as good and not need to have air added periodically, especially after the winter. At the very least they could have shipped them with air. We have an air compressor, but not everyone has a tire pump or compressor.I connected the hose, turned on the water, and no leaks. My 100 foot hose fits on the reel, but there isn't enough room for a second hose. Now that it's assembled and operational, it looks nice and is much sturdier than the old plastic cart it replaced.

B00D8QWUCY,Patio,"[0, 0]",5,"This is my third Miracle-Gro starter kit.  I've been using this product for so long I can't count the years.  When this one arrived, I compared it to the older two spray nozzles (which still work after a LOT of use):  This is the same as what I bought last year--not a single difference that I can see.  Does the fertilizer do its job?  Oh, my, yes!  And I surely wouldn't be a long-time user and supporter of this Miracle-Gro fertilizer if it didn't give me great results.Plus, it is so easy to use and convenient!  I use the general purpose for all the flowers, green plants and herbs.  Then I switch out the all-purpose bottle with the bottle developed specifically for vegetables for the veggie gardens.  For my very delicate maidenhair ferns and my non-flowering orchids, I screw the spoon attachment onto the (all-purpose) bottle instead of the nozzle and I use a weaker solution in a watering can.  (You squirt fertilizer from the bottle into the attached spoon (it has measurement lines), tip the spoonful into your watering can and go again.)Now, if you have a many-years-old model, there are differences; or if you've never used this product before, here's the scoop:  There are four spray configurations from which to choose; the turn knob at the top (for plain water / off / water-fertilizer mix) is easier to get a grip on and easier to turn; the handle is ergonomically correct, with on / off button easy to manipulate.  The bottle of liquid fertilizer (comes with one bottle) screws into the yellow end, so the nozzle as a whole looks a bit odd, but it is trying to do a balancing act with the bottle of fertilizer.Regarding the four spray choices:  The ""shower"" gives a good, general coverage--not too wide, not too heavy/harsh.  The ""flat"" works very well for me when it is very windy, or when I have plants close together in a line.  The ""stream"" is the configuration with all the tiny holes in the round; it also works for me when it is windy, or when I want to reach plants further away, as it is a more forceful spray.  The other one is ""jet"", and I don't use that much at all, because it really disturbs the soil around the base of the plant and is forceful enough to make a mess of flower petals.  But I suppose the jet spray is good for shooting into a container.If you've not used this product before, you should check on the price of replacement feeder bottles to see if it is in line with your budget:  You do pay for convenience!  If you've got a good-sized garden, you will go through many bottles of this fertilizer if you fertilize as often as the directions recommend.  I fertilize about once every two weeks.  So, once every two weeks, I switch out the nozzle heads on my hose and use this, then I water and fertilize at the same time.  Whalla!  And done!(I have tried to use this nozzle as my everyday nozzle, (because you can turn the knob on top to water only) but I think it is a bit too heavy and cumbersome for constant use.)One tip:  After fertilizing, switch the knob to water only and spray for a short minute to clear the insides of fertilizer solution, in an effort to prevent corrosion.  Happy gardening!This kit comes in a plastic ""stand"", with a hole for one bottle, the spoon and the nozzle.  I think it is a waste of plastic, and I don't think it adds value to the product.","03 1, 2014",AT53ZTTO707MB,I Do The Speed Limit,Same feeder spray nozzle as last year; solution works wonders!,1393632000

B0045R5VT4,Patio,"[0, 0]",5,"I've used Havahart Live traps for a number of years now for larger creatures like racoons and possums but I have a bit of a squirrel issue now and I wondered how to trap these smaller animals. I was delighted to see that Havahart has a trap designed for smaller critters.This trap is about the size of a 12 pack refrigerator box of sodas. It features two doors and an easy set lever on top of the trap. My very favorite thing about this trap is the large metal plate under the carrying handle. Not all traps have this and I've had some scary experiences trying to carry a trap with a raccoon in it, desperately trying to scratch and bite my hand through the wire under the carrying handle. This plate offers a lot of welcome protection for your hand, although I advise always wearing a thick leather glove when near any trapped animal.Depending upon what size creature you're trying to trap, you'll need to experiment with bait and whether or not to use one or two open doors. The mechanism for shutting the doors depends upon the animal depressing the center trip plate enough. Lighter animals may be able to get the bait without activating the trap. I advise using a big gob of peanut butter with some cereal or nuts or kibble smushed down into the peanut butter. It adds more weight and makes the creature work at it to get the nuts or cereal or kibble. You can also embed a metal nut in the peanut butter to add even more weight, if necessary.Also, if you find the bait has been taken but the trap didn't close, try using only one door open. You can easily do this by disengaging the second door cable from the setting loop.This trap does work for smaller animals but expect to experiment a little to trap your little pests. Also, be sure to check your trap at least twice a day because a small animal can dehydrate quickly in the trap, especially if it is frantically trying to get out. Releasing the animal safely is the whole reason for live traps anyway, right? So part of using these traps humanely is checking them often.When you do trap an animal, have an old towel or cloth ready to cover the cage before transporting it to a release area. The covering calms the animal down. When you reach the release area, place the trap on the ground and quietly open the trap. Move away from the trap until the animal has left and then retrieve your trap.Sometimes sharing space with small creatures causes big problems. This trap makes it easier to humanely relocate a problem animal.","06 18, 2014",A1FDSZISWIXH1A,"Terry ""tcinsatx@yahoodotcom""",Live Trap for small creatures,1403049600

My other Havahart trap catches many, but this one is too small and the two door thing doesn't help.  If you're trying to catch smaller critters, the easy set feature is really nice and the trap may work great, but was a failure for my intended purpose.The trap I received was a little different from the one pictured, so it might have been just a fluke that when I tried the one door method the trigger panel on the bottom was facing the wrong way.  There is a large hook on the top of the trap that holds one of the setting wires.  When you disengage that wire from the hook, the door to which the wire is attached stays closed when you set the trap.  The other wire is connected directly to the other door mechanism and can't be released.I tried the trap with both doors open first and didn't catch any critters even though the trap was sprung.  The directions say that if that happens, set it with only one door open, so I released the door wire from the top hook.  Didn't  make sense to me as the squirrel would trigger the panel before it was fully in the cage.  After multiple days, no squirrels were caught by this method nor was the trap sprung, so I decided to cut the wire to the door I thought should be the one left open (per the picture and common sense).  No takers that way either.It is hard to drop bait into the trap with only one door open because of the slant of the closed door and the fact that it's a solid panel, so I finally gave up on this trap and returned to the regular Havahart squirrel sized trap which is always effective.  It is harder to set, but more sensitive and snaps shut faster which is a requirement for squirrels.  Because it is larger, if a big squirrel comes by he will be caught just like a small squirrel, rather than springing the trap and getting away.I hoped this trap would be sturdier because eventually the other trap gets bent and won't set anymore so I have to replace it.  This one is sturdier, but since it's not effective for my needs, that doesn't help me.  I plan to put it in the barn as see if it catches mice, but will return to my regular method for squirrels.","05 10, 2014",AY3XPKRAMKKY7,C. G. King,"Not for squirrels, even small ones",1399680000

He/She tripped my wooden traps, yet escaped harm; managed to find my sticky traps and left behind fuzz and hair as proof that it yet again escaped.  I had even placed bags of pellet rat/mice poison underneath my home and it still managed to leave proof in my cabinets, bathroom and utility room that it was still alive and well.A friend/co-worker recommended that I try Motomco as it was what our employer used and it ended our mice problem at work.  I placed one of the1 Pack Dispos Bait Stationunderneath the Kitchen sink.  This was the one place that I could check daily for evidence of mice.

This feeder has some built in bee guards that protect from bees and a tiny ant guard which protects from wandering ants.  So far I have not been bothered by either when using this feeder.The feeder is an attractive copper with a glass bottle.  The bottle has a wide mouth for easy filling and the feeder comes with an initial supply of Perky Pet.  The bottom of my feeder is indeed removable and comes apart to clean the internals.  However, the bottom is plastic and does not stay connected unless I use the originally supplied twist ties to keep it affixed.  This also leads to some leakage over time.Overall &#8211; this is a very attractive feeder that is well-liked by the hummers.  My biggest issue is the design of the base and keeping the metal portion connected to the plastic bottom.  Other than that&#8230;this is a great upgrade for a traditional all-plastic feeder.","06 4, 2014",A1BK60GZ4QME6I,John W. Graham,Attractive - well liked,1401840000

B005NGLTZQ,Electronics,"[0, 0]",5,"I was initially torn about needing something like this.  Thing is, I like to do a lot of hiking and camping.  Typically I'd use my old Garmin GPS with its LCD screen and AA batteries for my navigation.  However, with some of the excellent hiking apps out there, I've found myself relying more on my iPhone for navigation duty, and it works well with some significant advantages over my 15 year old Garmin.  Thing is, those iPhones run through their batteries like crazy.Then this device hit my radar and I'm very glad it did.  The footprint on this isn't so large that making room for it in my ruck is a hassle, and it really is slim - the size of a small paperback book.  It does have some weight to it (which is a welcome thing, I think...beware of manufacturers claiming outrageous capacities that are really light) so you'll notice it in your pack.  But for multiday hikes it's just perfect for when you find yourself away from Normal and need to charge your device.I'm able to get 9-10 iPhone charges out of it before it runs out of power, so for those long hikes I think the sheer power capacity justifies the weight.  I won't rehash the technicals that other reviewers have gone through.  I'll just say that this device offers serious value and advantages for the money.  It's well built and solid.

I had another mount on the back of my 60 inch Sony:  ""VideoSecu Tilt LCD LED TV Wall Mount for 32-65"" LCD LED Plasma Television M80, rated at 165 pounds"" and decided to use it instead.  The 70 inch mount has 2 separate 16 x 8 wall plates, held together with 2 small screws.  The vertical plate in the picture is actually a plastic piece that covers the joint.  The 60 inch has a solid 30 x 9.5 wall plate; no joint.

Because of the cartridge design, you can improve your sound by simply buying a better stylus in the line (OM10, OM20, OM25, OM30, OM40) and you never need to change the cartridge.The arm on the RP1 is far superior to most in this price range and has the anti-skate set by slide that changes the magnetic setting.  The table will accept virtually any price cartridge and do it justice and some of the others in this price range won't.","04 1, 2014",A3P16J0AFQ32LI,Audiolad,Excellent - Not for beginners,1396310400

I was hoping that these, with just the wire connecting the two earbuds, would be a good alternative.  Overall, I like these, but there are a couple minor issues that could use improvement.  First the battery life is pretty bad.  3-4 hours of continuous use is all I get from a charge.  The in ear fit is ok, but could be better.  The little loops that tuck into your ear don't seem to do much, and I think I could get a better fit if I can find some comply foam tips to that fit these.  Also, the coating on the wire has some grip to it.  Depending on the shirt I wear, the wire sometimes grabs on the back of my shirt or neck when I turn my head and pulls the earbuds out of my ears a little.Other than the battery issue, I prefer these over the LG headset.

B00G4V0QSK,Electronics,"[0, 0]",5,"Prior to receiving this review sample I was happy with in-ear type phones, but always grabbed headphones when I wanted to listen to music without disturbing others, These phones changed that.  For one thing they are super comfortable. For another the sound is incredible. In fact I have been testing various phones - mainly from this brand, but also some Sennheiser models - and this is head and shoulders above the pack.I'll be honest and disclose that comfort edges out sound when phones sound good enough. I will normally not quibble over a few hundred Hz one way or the other as long as I can wear the phones without noticing them. These are not only unobtrusive, but downright comfortable, which is a major reason why these have now replaced my trustyBrainwavz HM9 Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Headphones.Soundwise the specs do not begin to describe the richness, especially bass. In fact, when I read the 20 Hz to 20 MHz range I thought that the sound would be somewhat generic for phones in this range. I own a pair of IEMs (in-ear monitors) that go as low as 18 Hz at the same 95dB at 1mW sensitivity, yet these sound much deeper than those. I love the balance of sound across the frequency spectrum as though it's on a smooth continuum. Every one of my test albums I played through these phones sounded so good that I decided that it's time to hang up the headphones and go with these.Part of the reason why I love these from a comfort perspective is the over the ear memory wire. I prefer that style, but not everyone does. They are definitely stiff and take on a shape that will be uniquely yours over time (and a very short time at that!) Also, while this ships with aBrainwavz Hard Earphone Casethe phones will not fit after you have contoured them to your ear. The case is useful for carrying around the array of adapters and tips that are included. In fact, the final reason I love these phones is the included triple-flange style silicon tips, which block out the rest of the world and allow me to focus solely on music.If you love music and want to hear every note faithfully reproduced in their natural frequencies these phones are it. I can honestly say that I have not used a better set of phones from any brand in this price range, including some Sennheiser models that have a street price of fifty to seventy-five dollars more than these, so the value is definitely there.","03 18, 2014",A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""",These won me over,1395100800

The worst electronic device I have ever had to return.Add-on: This TV also will not connect to a network to play any media that you have stored on any type of drive.

There was all types of crackle on the bass and I had to turn the tv up to 98 when watching movies.In any event this is simply the first part of the review as I have not had the chance to really put the system through it s paces. I just set it up last night and it was too late in the evening to be pumping out loud audio.I mainly wanted to share my initial impressions concerning the build quality and the setup.This is the first set of dedicated home speakers that I have ever purchased so I dont really have a solid frame of reference. Growing up I just used my Phillips home stereo cd/cassette player to output richer sound from my tv.The speakers and sub woofer are made of high grade glossy plastic. I am not mounting the speaker so I cant speak much to that but it certainly appears as though it would be a relatively painless process as they seem to give you everything you would need. I want to say the speakers feel good in your hands and are very dense and weighty . The design on them is striking and overall It really looks like a high quality 2.1 system. I was very impressed. I cant really over state the feel. Not that you will be going up and touching your speakers often but everything from the sat. speaker connectors on the woofer feel very well made. The only exception is the sensor fab. its made of a lower grade of plastic.In any event I had the system up and running in about 20 mins. Would take less time if you have a specific place for your equipment already etched out.So as far as audio I can only say right now that the low volume range is far greater than on my tv. I have a much larger lever of incremental range between no sound and comfortable low sound. Voices came through clear and seemed to be balanced which is a problem I often had with my tv speakers, where the music would overshadow voice overs.Will update when I have time to do better sound tests.Inputs 3.5mm Aux port, Red and white composite in, Digital optical audio port and Bluetooth.Looking forward to testing the Bluetooth playback.

B004HKIB6E,Electronics,"[0, 0]",4,"Addendum (3/10/2014):  Most of my issues with this product have now been solved.  Originally I had 2 of these, each of which was plugged into an ethernet switch, and the whole system, in 2 different rooms, was connected via a ""Powerline"" adapter.  Plugging directly into switches rather than into the router made it so this set up sort of worked most of the time, however there were still quite a lot of issues that I now believe were due to the use of Powerline adapters.  I ultimately had my house wired for ethernet cable, and now that I am no longer using powerline adapters and everything is wired directly, there are almost no issues with this product.  In addition, Silicondust continues to update their firmware and drivers, and I have found that these recent updates since I bought the 2 tuners have made the system much more stable.  Unless you are going to use these with a wired ethernet system I think you could just save yourself a lot of grief and use your cable company's standard DVR boxes and call it a day, since wireless and or bridging adapter technology such as MOCA or Powerline adapters are probably unlikely to give you a satisfactory experience with this Silicondust tuner product.Original Review below:There are hundreds if not thousands of online reviews of this product, many of which go into great detail.  I have owned two of these tuners for about 2 months now.  I have had quite a few issues with ""lost tuner"" type error messages, issues with Windows Media Center, etc., but have worked through most of them and for the most part I get stable performance with these.Don't rely on streaming HD Video throughout your house via wireless; it might happen at least some of the time, but don't count on it.  Wires are your friend :-)  Routers tend to mess up the HD TV signals that come out of these tuners.  If at all possible, invest in a gigabit switch and then plug the tuner and your computer that will be recording shows into the switch, NOT into the router.  In this set up the TV signals will remain in the switch except to the extent that they get broadcast outside of the switch and through the rest of your network.  If you plug this device and your computer's Ethernet cord into the same gigabit switch, the router will not have the opportunity to scramble or screw up the TV signals and you should be able to get good reception and recordings on your TV.  When isolated in a switch, all the router does is to assign an IP address to the traffic, but does not process the intra switch traffic.I am using Windows 7 Media Center.  Like all Microsoft products, it works well except when it doesn't :-)  If your recordings are important to you, then consider REDUNDANCY.  I have two of these SD HD Homerun Primes, in separate rooms, each plugged into gigabit switches, into which are also plugged in the TVs that are used for viewing and recording the programs.  Each computer independently records each of the programs I want to record.  That way, if one of the systems fails, the other one almost always gets the program recorded and you can transfer the missed programs to the other one on a portable hard disk or USB drive.  In my particular case, the connection between the router and the ""second independent system plugged into a gigabit switch"" is a set of powerline adapters, however you could do this in any of several ways to connect the two systems (Cat 5e or 6 cable would be best but is not an easy option in my house).  With this sort of hardware (and software, especially if Microshaft is involved) redundancy is your friend.My only caution would be that these things likely will require some technical capabilities and a lot of patience on your part to get installed and running reliably.  If you are not a technically oriented person, and if you can't deal with frustration, LOTS of frustration, do yourself a favor and have your Cable Guy install whatever system the cable provider is hawking at the moment.  You'll sleep better.Good luck.","02 5, 2014",A3KRBCYGXC9CG3,"foiegras ""foiegras""",Some operational issues but would not go back,1391558400

In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, with a high gloss, two tone color scheme of white and blue. Also, the AC prongs fold into the charger, which makes it easier to carry in the pocket (less scratches on your leg).This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge two devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before using, be sure to use the correct port you need for the device being charged. You can charge up to two devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will be limited to 3.1A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and Galaxy Note 2 at the same time.

The replacement unit addressed the port sizing issues described below and I've had no issues with any USB devices not fitting into any of the hub's ports. Great customer service and the replacement product works as advertised.  I'd certainly recommend this product (and more importantly, this company) to anyone.  It also goes to show the importance of honestly reviewing products you purchase online.  You might be pleasantly surprised by the experience.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/5 stars): I picked this up because my new laptop only has 2 USB ports and I was consuming both of them between my mouse's receiver and my required GbE dongle... this does what it purports and turns 1 port into 4, but I have issues with some USB devices even fitting into the ports (my mouse's receiver was one. I've had 2 or 3 USB thumb drives that were difficult to insert).  After fiddling a bit, I was able to get the thumb drives inserted, but the mouse receiver is still a no-go.  I've since replaced the mouse with a true bluetooth mouse that requires no receiver and picked up a USB 3.0 dual-head graphics adapter that includes a GbE port as well so the need to use this regularly no longer exists. In a pinch I can use it to connect a couple of devices when I need to but it's not the best experience I've had and I could only recommend it to someone who's knowledgeable enough to know what should be able to connect so they are willing to force the adapters into the ports.

Light weight, but then that's what i needed as I'll be carrying it to locations. I'll have to buy a case as there isn't one in the kit. Something I overlooked when purchasing... Lesson learned. I'll also need sandbags as the reflector will be gone with the wind otherwise. In a good gust sandbags probably won't be enough. (Sigh!) Next is that contraption for mounting the boom arm to the stand. This is the most worthless piece in the kit! I found the video on YouTube ([...]) with instructions for assembly of this, but honestly it looked as if even she could not get it to tighten on the stand during the video, which is the same problem I am having.All in all I'll keep the reflector but purchase another.

The Pentax K100D camera is a very basic camera that is best for people new to DSLR photography.  The Pentax K100D camera is simple to use since it kacjs the more complex features of higher end DSLRS.  I would not pay more than $250 dollars for a very good condition Pentax K100D camera  unless you must have one in new condition.  I was able to get some really great very good condition Pentax K100D camera's for about $200 each total with shipping.  I brought 3 of the Pentax K100D camera model.  I love that this camera takes standard AA batteries.  One reviewer states the AA batteries did not last. I took over 200 pictures out and about in my home town Towson, Maryland and never changed the baterries. I took more than 75 flash pictures in my house without needing to change batteries.  I just used Duracell's.  I have rechargable AA batteries I just have not started using them in my Pentax K100D camera.The pictures right out of the camera are awesome.  I shoot in raw format, keeping the RAW file and converting copies of the raw file to JPG or TIFF images for common production use. The camera has no video feature but I neither want or miss it. I have a dedicated video camera for making quality video movies. The Pentax K100D camera  accepts the standard K Pentax lenses.  The Pentax K100D camera is a stubby little camera great for a person like me with small hands. My big 6 ft 8 in 298 pound brother has hands the size of baseball mitts but he can navigate this camera's controls with only slight issues.I have found this Pentax K100D camera  to be a great beginners camera and a great backup camera.  I have a Pentax K30 and a Pentax K5 but I am not yet a true photographer. I am still learning my hobby of photography. When I am good enough to leave auto focus for good and have some camera skills I will move up to my K5.  While I am still learning my DSLR basics the Pentax K100D camera  gives me the freedom to learn, make mistakes and recover quickly. I do better with learning when I do not fear making a mistake. The Pentax K100D camera is a cheap basic DSLR that takes great pictures while teaching you DSLR basics.The Pentax K100D camera has only six megapixels, 6 MP which is more than enough for my picture taking needs since I will never produce images over 8"" x 10"".  If I ever need poster sized prints I'll haul out my Pentax K5 and shoot till I get what I want. This is a great camera even in the aftersale \ used marketplace. If you want a quality AA battery powered DSLR camera at a good price in reasonable condition I'd act now. I have cerebral palsyand do not drive. You can buy AA batteries in almost any hotel lobby shop, convenience martor drug store.

I used to have older APC models but the batteries died and it was either buy replacement batteries or spend $50 more for these units.  These units have the added benefit of a main plug that when it draws less than the specified amount (sleep mode on a computer or shutting a tv off) other plugs can be disabled to stop drawing power when the main device is off.  This does have a negative but it doesn't bother me.  Since I had so many plugs on 1 unit that I wanted to stay on on the time and so many that I wanted to shut off on my other unit I had to add power strips in to connect everything to the type of plug I wanted.  Also keep in mind this isn't meant to keep your devices on for long periods of time.  It is meant to give you time to shut everything off.  At about half draw (400 watts) I get about 10 minutes.  At 250 watts I get 30 minutes.  Another useful feature is this unit has a led screen that can tell you the amount of time left, watts being used, and more.  Since I use this with home theater equipment I was worried the screen would stay on all the time.  The screen shuts off if you are not actively pushing buttons.

B000FVVKQM,Electronics,"[0, 2]",3,"This antenna performed no better than a GE attic antenna which cost 2.5 times as less. I'll just copy and paste the review I did for theGE 24792 Compact Attic Mount Antenna with Mount:-------------------------------------------"" I'm amazed by this little GE antenna. Before carrying it to the attic, I wanted to see if it would perform next to my TV's with a 3 foot cable and no preamp. On one TV I got around 35% signal strength on 4 of 5 UHF stations that are about 57 miles away (a couple are 22-27 miles). This was in the center of my house, 8 ft off the ground (crawlspace + my height). The signal was beaming through a bedroom, so at least two walls to get to the outside. Also, I'm aiming through trees (tall oaks, trunks only) and hilly terrain.  I'm going to compare this antenna to (1) a 15 year old 8 bay with 300ohm connector and a 15 year old channel master preamp, (2) a Channel Master CM-4228 antenna and Channel Master CM-7778 preamp, (3) G.E. Attic antenna and Channel Master CM-7778 preamp. All three antennae were tested in the same location in my attic. There was really not a lot of difference in signal strength between the three setups. The GE actually got slightly better performance overall, raising the signal strength 5 points on a couple of channels.In my attic, I'm aiming through the roof, of course. The line of sight is obstructed, again, by the trunks of about six very tall trees, all within 250 feet, with the nearest two being about 50 feet. I mounted the GE at the very top of the roofline rafter. This places the antenna about 25-30 feet above ground level. Here is the signal strength I'm getting on 7 primary channels I can receive using the GE antenna. The mileage is calculated by TVFOOLS.COM. Note that the stations 57 miles away have their tower based on top of a 1,621 foot mountain. My antennae is pointing at 102 degrees. I had a TV close by that I could view from the attic. Cable length was about 35 feetChannel A: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 90Channel B: 57.5 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 84Channel C: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 83Channel D: 57.6 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 78Channel E: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 85Channel F: 22.5 miles, 74 degrees , Signal Strength: 83Channel G: 27.6 miles, 213 degrees, Signal Strength: 71Once I connected my two way splitter and moved the test TV back to the bedroom, I lost about 10 pts of signal on each station, but the picture is still perfect with no pixelation. My TV locations require about 50ft and 75ft of cable from the TV to the antenna. In total, I get about 15 digital channels, with 7 of those being the primary channel.It takes a few minutes to assembly and you have to be careful. The mounting hardware allows you to place the antenna just about anywhere. I have it mounted, hanging down from an angled rafter. TV signals can be strange, so your mileage may vary with any antenna. If you can't get a signal, no antenna in the world is going to help. ""---------------------------------------------Unfortunately, I had to take a loss shipping this Channel Master back to Amazon ( I kept the preamp). If you plan on mounting outside, then the Channel Master will serve you well as the GE wouldn't hold up under a Spring breeze.","04 3, 2014",A2GL70AZ8MWXI3,GWT,Not amazed.,1396483200

Otherwise, the second the OS recognizes that it has 0% battery it shuts off.

Not ruinous mistakes but nonetheless.I use this to run from my computer or music player / phone / what have you - to my headphones with a line-in jack.Were I using it as a patch cable from a music player to an aux jack in my car, etc it would be fine but as wear it on my head I need more flexibility than is offered by this cable.The flat ribbon-style cable is perfect in theory and the photos make it seem ideal but in actuality it is too thick. It does NOT tangle, I'll give it that - but were it mildly thinner it would be ideal. It is thick enough that a smaller, regular round cable would be more manageable as this cable tends to find it's way into my line of sight... constantly following the movement of my head and winding up in front of my keyboard, under my elbow, etc.The plug is also fairly long which I suppose (in retrospect) is noticeable in the photos so I should have considered that. I had the entire scale wrong from looking at the pictures. The silver plug and the ribbon cable are both much bigger and thicker than they seem in scale from that pic.All that said, it sounds good and it does not tangle so it's very manageable when taking the headset on and off often and shoving the whole mess to the side as I am prone to do.I have yet to experience the need to untie a knot or any other nonsense. I simply pick up the headset and put it back on - it has never caught on itself nor anything else (and THAT makes the rest perfectly acceptable.)","02 26, 2014",AFHYYJJ5T8MVU,Kenneth White,Flat cable is a good idea poorly implemented,1393372800

Advice: use the external USB connector first until the device is paired with your computer and the drivers and everything is  working, otherwise, you will be taking the cover on and off a few times like I did.  Now that it is working with my computer, it is as if it were attached with the USB cable, so no need to chose a USB or Bluetooth printer when printing.

B009S61AC4,Electronics,"[2, 2]",4,"I received what is effectively a DOA card, here's the catch though, initially I could shoot with it in my Canon 5D3.  What happened is I received the card and immediately threw it in the camera and shot a few pics.  It came formatted so that was not an issue.  Then, I read the most popular review for it on here and saw the notes about how you don't achieve ideal performance until you run a Transcend AutoFormat utility pass over it to re-format the card in complete (slow) mode and then re-do a quick format from the camera.So that's what I started out trying to do.  Downloaded the AutoFormat utility, began the format process, but it hung at 46.55% and went no further.  Quit, tried again, same point it hangs.  I tried formatting from Windows 7 itself, that ultimately hung and failed after a few hours, same behavior on my MacBook Pro.  I tried AutoFormat once more and this time it produced an actual fail message.  I'm guessing there are some bad memory cells in the card I received.In any case, the purpose of my review is primarily to let you know that with a 64 GB card, that you only quick format, or perhaps just use right out of the box, you may shoot for a while before running into any bad portions and if you reach that point and the filesystem on the card becomes corrupt, you could lose your pictures.  I'd recommend using the AutoFormat utility on any new card just to be sure it can complete the entire pass before you put the card into use.I got a second one from Amazon, no hassle exchange, ran AutoFormat slow mode with zero errors, did quick format in the Canon 5D Mark III, no errors, and have shot on it until full with no issues.  I quick format it frequently in the camera after I've transferred images off and have yet to encounter any errors, so I think I just got a bad card, but I still strongly recommend you AutoFormat slow first to ensure your card is 100%.  Transfers on/off are very fast if you have a USB3 card reader.  It's definitely a pricey card but if you need to do burst shooting in a high-MP DSLR, it's what you need.","01 9, 2014",A1THXEB6HIGSAD,DH,Initial issues,1389225600

At a full +12 db Bass, the headphones will rumble like rolling thunder, and increasing the treble will yield higher highs.-Bass: Excellent bass potential, should the user desire so. I would call myself a slight &#34;bass head&#34; and I think these cans function well in feeding my addiction.-Mic: Has an audio playback feature so you're not screaming at the top of your lungs, but doesn't function as well at higher volumes. Friends say there's significantly less background noise than my last set, so that's a plus. Mic mutes when lifted all the way, good feature.-Sound leak: They're very good at keeping sound in. Roommates say they can't hear my dubstep when I blast it at full volume when they're a few feet away.-Includes voice changer software as well that includes 6 voices, 2 of them absolutely hilarious and make my friends soil themselves with laughter most of the time, those being Giant and Space Squirrel.-Surround Sound: I don't think that I can ever go back to non-surround sound headsets. Virtual it may be, it's still mind-blowing to hear the audio from every* direction.-Programmable G-keys are functional and useful if you can think of a need to use them. Definitely a lot of capabilities there.-Loud. High audio possibilities.-Thick, sturdy cable of a wire.There's only one con, but...it's huge.-The headphones, because they're USB, CONSTANTLY DISCONNECT FROM MY COMPUTER AND NEVER WANT TO GO BACK TO FUNCTIONING. I don't know if it's the headphones or if it's my crappy USB ports, but I'll go days without issue and then it'll happen 4 times in an hour on Skype.

They arrived in what looked like homemade packaging and very late, given the shipping that I paid for.  Amateur hour at best.  I have to wonder who we are dealing with.  It is a real antenna and it does send/receive a better signal than what I was using before.  Sadly, neither of the antennas will stand up on their own and need external support.  That's OK in my situation, but it may not be for many others.  There is zero support documentation offered with this product, not even a few suggestions about how to orient the antennas for best performance.  Nothing.  Attempts to contact the vendor bombed - no phone number other than a recording, no website and several direct emails have gone  **unanswered** for several weeks.  This is NOT an A++ vendor.IMO, Amaxon should monitor these fringe vendors more closely - or simply stop using them.  On the future, if the produce is is not marked &#34;Sold and delivered by Amazon,&#34; (or what ever it says), I'm NOT buying.  If the product comes from Amazon, someone is accountable and returns are trouble-free when rarely necessary.  When dealing with the second or third string of Amazon's add-on vendors, the results are mixed.  Never again will I use one of them.  Period.  -C.  This product may have potential, but as-is, I found it essentially worthless.  If you are a radio engineer and know how to aim antennas, it may work for you.

I have a Dell Windows laptop that's has incredible specs; however, I don't find myself ever using it to its maximum capabilities. So why should I drag around 6.5 lbs with me all day? The Acer C720 is incredibly light and it's much thinner than it appears in the pictures. The build is very nice for a $199 laptop. It uses a sturdy matte colored plastic which I actually find rather attractive. It doesn't look toy-like.The screen is something that many people have complained about but I find it perfectly satisfactory. The resolution is good enough for the size of the screen and it's plenty bright to be used in sunlight especially since it's a matte display. The keyboard is nicely spaced and the keys feel okay at best. The keys are very shallow which I don't particularly like but I can understand why they had to do that. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but after a day's use, the keyboard should feel fine. My WPM fell about 10 from my average 85-90 WPM on a desktop keyboard but after several days, I'm starting to get back up to that range. The trackpad is really nice. It has a nice smooth texture and it's responsive. I don't know what some of the other review have been saying about it being loose. Mine is definitely sturdy. It does make a loud click but if you turn on &#34;tap to click&#34; you'll only actually have to make a loud click when you have to grab and drag something.I bought this laptop to primarily use out and about for work so it was very important for me to have it open my PDFs. I put my PDF files on the 16gb hard drive and they open right up with the Chrome PDF viewer. Perfect! All of my documents, music, and photos were already in the Google cloud so as soon as I turned the laptop on, everything was ready to be viewed.The battery is rather amazing as well considering how light this laptop is. The machine came with no power. Once I plugged it in, it took just over an hour to charge. On my first charge, I've managed to get just under 9 hours! Wow! My usage was pretty light though. Primarily opening up books, reading news, typing two emails, and watching a couple of youtube videos. Still, that's an awesome battery life.In terms of Chrome OS, I think it has a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. Sure, it can't run Photoshop or autoCAD, but I think the majority of people don't use those programs. I, personally, don't need anything more than what Chrome OS offers. If you really need some kind of editing tool, the Chrome Store has replacement apps that can get the job done. You just have to look for those apps or just Google search for them.Speed on this little guy is incredible! I can't believe that a $199 machine can work this quickly. Pages load up almost instantly and that includes videos. In terms of browser performance, the Acer beats my Windows laptop (which has a Core i7, 8gb ram, and a SSD). I don't know how Google accomplished this but it's truly incredible. I think the 4gb model is overkill. This 2gb model has not slowed on me. I use a max of about 10 tabs. The laptop never lags or skips a beat with that many open. I personally don't use more than that at any one time; however, I've heard that this thing can handle up to 20 tabs without slowing down. I can't imagine how many you'd need to open for the 4gb model to slow down.In general, this is a 5 star machine. If you're looking for a productivity machine that can entertain you during breaks, then look no further. This is the one!","06 4, 2014",A3BK4862BVLQ1S,J.

The ear cushions are very comfortable, and for me, I can get a very good fit that remains comfortable for hours (I wear these for long as hell high school swim meets). The highs and mids are both good, especially compared to their SOL counterparts, and I feel they easily beat all those ""mainstream headphones"" out there: Beats, Monster DNAs, Soul,  Steet and Skullcandies. The bass is the strongest part, with equal emphasis on boom and tight thuds. We all know Beats and co, for instance, also have beefed up bass, so the reason SOL is better is actually because their MIDS are very competent. These cans are very capable of playing rock and metal (some examples of those two would be Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, In Flames, and Soilwork). There is a sound separation I can note too, I feel like I can tell the various instrumentals apart. I dont want anyone comparing these to $300 Shures, of AKGS, or Sennheisers, because that's not they are for. On the other hand, I actually wasn't at all impressed by the $150 sennhesiers at Best Buy.Overall, these are well worth the money, and you can get them a little cheaper through Amazon. I would recommend testing the fit at a local store though, because the very nice headphone has a drawback: you cant adjust the angle the cans go on your ear, so people with stick-out ears may have a bigger issue. They work great for me, and my biggest criticism is the sound isolation is only average. There are a few cracks in the fit, which probably goes for everyone.

The outer edges of the internal circle that is your onscreen view will be out of focus, but this is to be expected. The only major issue I have is that it can very difficult to properly focus your image (the iPhone doesn't help either with its automatic focusing).With that said, the little tripod is great for getting stabilized shots, and the 12X allows for picture capture that is really impressive, considering the whole thing costs $20. I also like this adapter over shooting images by holding the phone up to binoculars because it is a a whole lot easier AND the image encompasses the entire screen, while doing a shoot through a binocular phone setup will leave a black outer rim from where the binocular eye piece is.This thing is sturdy too and works as reported, but the optics are not the best thing out there, but you get what you pay for and this is a perfect find for $20.","02 18, 2014",A3SUS6I829SPU1,C.

The case is padded nicely, the black leather like exterior works nicely with the grey sueded interior.  The pad is unlined, but that's not an issue for me as I bought this with the intention of replacing the pad with an 8x5 pad (if you plan to do this, you will need a good sharp pair of scissors or a steady hand and a sharp razor to cut about a quarter of an inch off of each side of the cardboard on an 8x5 pad of paper...but it fills that side of the folio much better in my opinion than the non-standard funky sized pad they send in it).

I find myself using this mostly on my TV while watch previously recorded episodes of ""The Blacklist"" without waking up the whole house.In the hand the transmitter is very light, and smaller than a pack of ""Tic-Tacs"". The design is very clean and makes using it a breeze. There is just one button, used for powering on/off and paring the device. A small LED light for status indication. The charging port blends in so well, you might overlook it. Last but not least, is the 3.5mm audio plug.Once you have found the audio source of your liking, just plug in the transmitter. Then put both the transmitter and Bluetooth headset into pairing mode. After they are connected, you can enjoy your favorite TV shows or music at your own volume without disturbing anyone else.Yes, this device has an internal batter that needs be charged. I get about nine hours of listening time before it goes dead. Attached to a USB port or wall charger, it takes 2 hours to fully charge. I know some people might object to having to always charge the device at the most inopportune time. I have found the perfect solution, while the transmitter is plugged into the TV, use one of the USB ports on the TV as a charging port. Now you can watch as much TV without having to ever disconnect the transmitter, it will stay charged.The best part is it can fit in your hand and be used on any headphone jack.Contents:iClever Bluetooth TransmitterUSB Charging CableUser ManualFEATURES:Bluetooth Version: 2.1 + A2DPOperating Rang: 33ft (10m)Audio Plug: 3.5mmCharging Time: 2 HoursPlaying Time: 9-10 HoursDimensions: 1.77 x 1.25 x 0.31in (45 x 32 x 8mm)Weight: 0.49oz (14g)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","03 6, 2014",A18U49406IPPIJ,Deon,Listen To TV At Your Own Volume,1394064000

B000P0NJOO,Electronics,"[1, 1]",5,"I had taken my 2003 Silverado in to have a 100w Bazooka Tube Sub back in 2003 since the OEM head and speakers just couldn't do bass at all. I figured the OEM speakers could just handle the mid-bass and treble. The salesman thought I was crazy, but he and I liked the sound after installing the Bazooka. At the time, the salesman at the stereo shop talked me out of changing out the 4 OEM speakers, and I went with it. Never turned the bass on the head over 25% and adjusted the Bazooka accordingly. Over time I realized the treble had become a little harsh, but I lived with it. Truck got broken into in around 2008, all they took was the Bazooka tube. They would've stole the head had I replaced it...learned that from a prior vehicle...don't replace the stereo, it invites thieves. Insurance company actually replaced the sub with a 250w Bazooka...more power!Now, many years later, 2014, I can tell that I blew at least the front passenger speaker, so time to swap em all out. Thought about a new head unit, but decided to try new speakers with the OEM head first. Picked up a pair of Polk Audio DB651 for the front doors, and a pair of these DB461P for the rear extended cab doors. Wow!!! I had almost never heard any sound coming out of my rear speakers til I installed these. Great highs and mids, and handle a lot more bass than the OEM's ever did. Now I run the OEM head at about 50% bass so I get more mid bass, still letting the Bazooka handle the low bass duties. These speakers all handle max volume of the head while remaining perfectly clear, listening to the heaviest of metal!!Installation was not all that difficult, had to remove all the door panels, plenty of YouTube vids explaining how to do that. Grabbed some of the Metra 72-4568 Speaker Harnesses for $6 a pair making the connections simple. Had to drill in to the inner steel of the door to mount them. Very thin steel there, so not a big deal. Couple hours invested and much better sound.I highly recommend them!!!","04 7, 2014",A1B5TCK4WDM13Z,JJK,Great Sound With OEM Radio,1396828800

B00EZ9XG62,Electronics,"[0, 0]",4,"The first thing you'll notice about this keyboard cover is how nice the keyboard keys feel to the touch. I expected a compromised keyboard that had to sacrifice construction quality and key response in order to be light enough to serve as a cover for the iPad Air without adding so much to the bulk of the tablet as to make it something you wouldn't want to use very often.I was very wrong. I own a few other Logitech keyboards and this one can hold its own with them any day of the week.During use, the tablet rests comfortably in the slot, holding the tablet at a good angle for visibility. Tapping on the keys will not dislodge the iPad Air from that slot, which is a very good thing, as you really don't want an expensive tablet falling down and then bouncing from the table to the floor.Not only do you have a very nice Bluetooth keyboard, it also functions as a cover to protect the screen of the iPad Air. The tablet snaps into place quite well, and the weight and/or bulk that it adds does not make you wish that it was thinner or lighter.The only complaints that I had while using it leading up to this review are some quirks with the keystrokes and scrolling using the arrow keys. Copying and pasting with a keyboard is a lot easier than using your finger (in my opinion), so this was a joy to try out the first time.What I didn't expect was that the keystrokes for copy and paste do not mimic Windows, but rather the Mac. I guess that makes sense, given that the iPad is a cousin to the Mac, but would it have been so wrong to enable CTRL-C and CTRL-V as well as CMD-C and CMD-V? It didn't take me long to figure out what I was doing wrong, but others might not have experience with the Mac keystrokes and will end up confused. Even a note in the box mentioning it would have been a welcome touch.While in Safari, I expected the arrow keys to function like I am accustomed to them functioning in my web browsers on the desktop. I use my up and down arrow keys to scroll a page while I read (or the mouse scroll wheel, but no such thing on this keyboard), and I was surprised when hitting the down arrow key didn't scroll the document I was reading (maybe it's not the Mac way?).Aside from those two very minor issues, I can't think of anything wrong with this product. The price is a little high, but street prices fluctuate, so if that's a concern, keep an eye out for sales and price reductions and jump when you're comfortable.One side note, while I did the testing of fit and function with an iPad Air, I also tried out an iPad 4 to see if it would work. Electronically, it worked like a champ, which I expected it to. Unfortunately, the physical slot that holds the iPad is not made for the iPad 4, so while it will hold the tablet initially, it will not stay there, and you'll find yourself catching the tablet as it starts to lose its place and before it smacks the table or demonstrates the laws of gravity for you.I think you'll like this item, both as a keyboard and as a protective cover!

I'm not going to go into details why I think it is an awesome DSLR because someone else probably already stated all those reasons. I didn't buy the D7100 hoping for better image quality vs the D5100. Both have similiar image quality and impossible to tell apart. Some said, the D7100's high ISO performance isn't that great vs the D5100. It's actually slightly better, but not by much according to my tests. Keep in mind you're viewing a 24mp vs 16mp too.Tested the D610 before making my choice to go with the D7100. The D610 isn't a  bad camera, but can't stand all the focus points cluttered into a tight space. The D7100 also seem to focus faster too with the same lens (50mm F/1.8).  If i were to go full frame, i would skip directly to the D800's. Personally I think the D7100 is better than the D610 and D700. I do mostly daylight photography, so paying extra $$$ for low light performance isn't worth it and it's not like the D7100 sucks in low light anyway. I get usable/good pictures up to ISO 3200.Only a few thing I don't quite like about this DSLR.****The ISO button cannot be programmed to another button. when using a light lens, it's not so bad, but when using a heavy lens like the 70-200 F/2.8, it's tough.EDIT: 4/9/14 &lt;Dropped 5 stars to 4>After 1000 shots, about 20-30 small spots appeared across the whole frame at F22.

To RMA, you need to work with them to solve the problem. If they give up, they will authorize you to RMA. The replacement will be a REFURBISHED/RECERTIFIED one, not NEW.

B00HNFPZF0,Electronics,"[1, 1]",4,"POSITIVES:This protective case is amazing. The case literally makes my ipad air feel like it is completely protected. What I especially love is the fact that the case also covers your SCREEN (plastic shield).  So, I will NEVER scratch my ipad screen. I was surprised at how response the plastic cover over the ipad air screen would be. I had been buying the cheap plastic covers to go on my screen, but I do not need to do that with this case. It truly does protect every single side of my ipad air.The handle on the back is great! I first thought to myself, ""boy, this handle looks stupid. What is it for?"" But, after using my ipad air to read kindle and other electronic books, I can say that having the handle on my hand allows me to REST so my the strain of holding my ipad is gone! The fact that I can rotate the handle is perfect for folks who read electronic books.I'm also a speed walker. I walked 30 minutes fast pace with nothing but my hand in the handle of the ipad case and my ipad did not fall, nor did I even think it would fall. It truly makes the ipad feel secure.NEGATIVES:Because the case surrounds the bezel, it is almost impossible to relocate icons in landscape view. Go ahead. Try it! Hold down one of your icons in landscape view to the point where all of the icons shake, which signals that you can now move them on different screens... Now, try to move one icon on one screen to another screen in landscape mode/view. You can't because the trent case covers up so much of your ipad's bezel that you have to rotate your ipad air back into portrait view to move your icons to other screens. Maybe it's just MY case.  But, I cannot do it in landscape view at all!The instructions should be in color or should be a photo of the actual case. I first had the hardest time getting the case open to place my ipad in it because I couldn't figure out where along the edges, I was suppose to open the case.  I kept pulling and pulling and then thinking, maybe this isn't the right spot because the case won't open.  I wish I could see a better image on the instruction sheet.  It turns out it was the right spot, but the case is a bear to open up!  You will think you're going to break it to get it open.  Perhaps the areas to open the case should have been a different color, rather than the same color as the case.  Additionally, once I finally got the case open and placed my ipad air in it and snapped it back shut, I then read the NEXT line of instructions. The next line talked about how I could adjust the strap for my hand.Well, guess what? The strap was too large for my hand, so I had to RE-OPEN the case and REMOVE my ipad air. Then, because the straps are so secure on the little screws to adjust it, I had to use a great deal of strenght to remove the strap to tighten it up. I felt like I was going ot break the strap. By the time I repositioned the strap and placed my ipad air back in the case, I had several finger prints and smudges INSIDE the case and on my ipad, so I had to clean it with a soft rag before placing it back in the case again.I guess my point is, the instructions for adjusting the hand strap should be the FIRST thing mentioned. Otherwise, you're going to have folks placing their ipad in the case, securing it and THEN reading about adjusting the strap and they will have to RE-OPEN  the case all over again. The strap is automatically adjusted for the largest hands. Why? Perhaps it should be adjusted just one notch down for those who have average sized hands.It's because of these two issues that I reduced it to 4 stars, rather than rate it at 5.","03 8, 2014",A1TNW9CI3E6EX7,BigPhotoShow,This baby TRULY protects your ipad.

B00FRDUZXM,Electronics,"[2, 4]",4,"PROS- Amazing photos! Of course. You already knew this. The shallow depth-of-field you can get with this is amazing, with the full-frame sensor, at maximum aperture. (Well technically, the sensor doesn't produce shallow depth of field, the lens focal length does. And at the same distance and framing, a larger sensor requires a longer focal length [shorter depth-of-field] than a smaller one. It's all interrelated.)- Love all the customizable buttons.- I can't get over the size of this thing. It's so small (yet useable). If you were to remove the battery grip, the swivel mechanism for the LCD monitor, and the viewfinder - this thing would fit in any pocket. (Well minus the lens.)- Multiple pro photography websites call this sensor the best currently in the world, or very close to it. The 55mm f/1.8 prime lens has been tested as the second-best lens ever tested by some magazine. (Behind a Leica lens.)- The idea of apps is pretty cool.- It has a really cool single-shot HDR-like feature (forgetting the name). Basically it takes a darker image than you chose, then brings up the shadows while leaving the highlights the same. I've used this exact same method for over a decade - I adjust exposure compensation down a couple of clicks, then bring the shadows up in post. This helps prevent blown-out highlights, and assuming your ISO is low enough, doesn't increase shadow noise much (because the camera can choose a lower ISO than you would use otherwise). The only drawback is that if you dial this effect up too much, the images look a little flat. There isn't as much contrast to pop. And there seems to be a slight &#34;HDR&#34;-ish local contrast effect. Not as obvious as HDR mode, but it I think it's there.- Focus peaking feature is awesome, even in the mostly auto-focus mode that also uses it.- Manual focusing is easy with automatic &#34;pixel zoom&#34; and focus peaking.- The continuous focus mode is really cool. You can focus and recompose, and watch the focus box follow what you originally focused on. (How do they do that! That's like machine vision. In a camera.)PSEUDO-CONS- Viewfinder isn't very good. Not high-res enough. But...what do you expect? You are buying a mirrorless camera! It's not an SLR.- The kit lens isn't amazing. Better than I feared, worse than I hoped. Will definitely invest in a more expensive lens.- The HDR feature does too much &#34;local contrast&#34; and looks too flat/&#34;HDR-ey&#34;. It would have been nice if there were a menu option letting you specify how to present the dynamic range. Specifically, instead of contrast masking with overdone local contrast, I'd rather it collapsed the dynamic range. And better yet, collapsed the dynamic range with more than 8 bits per color of JPEG; i.e., collapsed dynamic range with 16 bits-per-color raw. (Or even the native 14 bpc. You might think that 14 bpc only contains 75% more data than 8 bpc. You'd be wrong, it's actually 6,400% times more information.) But, sometimes it works pretty well.- Why doesn't focus peaking work in full auto-focus mode? It would be really nice to see what the autofocuser has decided will be in focus, above and beyond the crude green brackets/squares.CONS (-1 star for these)- Startup is too slow. Not intolerable, just too slow for a camera this expensive.- They give you two customizable dial positions that you can program however you want. That's great - Canon doesn't have that. But I need more!- Vignetting is quite noticeable at wide aperture, even in JPEG mode with automatic lens correction. At f/8.0 though, it goes away. But still - one of the main points of a full-frame sensor is getting that beautiful DOF, which means using wide aperture.- Camera has &#34;auto ISO&#34; setting, BUT NO MINIMUM SHUTTER SPEED SETTING! What the heck? Well actually it does - the minimum is 1/60. But it's not user-adjustable. 1/60 is not fast enough for longer focal lengths. Waiting for a firmware upgrade.- Sucker is LOUD. You'd think that with no mirror to flop out of the way, it would be whisper-quiet. Nope. Loud as heck. Somewhat satisfying, but still loud.CAN'T COMMENTI haven't done long exposures yet - which is something I like to do.

B008THTWIW,Electronics,"[0, 0]",4,"First, let me say that my family owns two 5th gen iPod touches, one 4th gen iPod touch and a 1st gen iPad Mini.  I have tried both the clear and the matte screen protectors on all four devices.  As far as brands go, this is one of the better ones.  There are still problems getting these screen protectors on without bubbles and especially little micro fibers getting underneath during the process.  This is not the manufacturers fault but it is still irritating.  I usually end up using two to three screen protectors each time before I can get them right, and obviously I have done this a few times.  There videos are great, but you still have to do it a few times before you can get it right.  The tape that they include is okay, but kind of useless because it is so small.  With my fat fingers, I usually put more prints on the screen rather than picking up the micro fibers.  A bigger piece of tape would be nice.Now on to the actual product review.  Like I said, I have tried both the clear and the matte finishes on both the 5th gen iPod touch with retina and the 1st gen iPad Mini without retina.  The clear screen protectors give you the best picture, but picks up fingerprints and glare just as bad as the screen without anything.  The matte screen protector does a good job against glare, but it does mess with the retina display pretty bad, and is still not all that great even without the retina.  Also, the matte does not pick up fingerprints, but what is does is it gets cloudy from the skin off your fingers which can end up making your screen look cloudy, and it is tougher to wipe off than the clear screen protectors.Overall, in my opinion, they are both decent products, but not great as they both have their shortcomings.  I think maybe what I will try next is the Ballistic Glass that Tech Armor offers.  Unfortunately it is much more expensive, like $30 each instead of $7 for three.  Maybe some time in the future I will splurge.  I still think Tech Armor is among the best out there though.","01 10, 2014",A3MBFF31BX6C2Q,RanMag01,Undecided whether to buy again or not.,1389312000

I also have a nice Logitech, but that cost a lot more than this one.About this keyboard:* It's relatively small, lightweight, and thin.* I like the feel of the keys while typing.* What's pretty cool is that you can put the keyboard in ""Android"", ""Windows"", or ""iOS"" mode by pressing Fn+Q, Fn+W, or Fn+E. It changes the functions of some of the keys. It seems to work well.* The 4 LED lights are nice (well designed). The power LED will go off after 4 seconds, probably to save power.* It includes 4 rubber (or rubber like) feet to stick on the bottom of the keyboard. I wish it included more as I put one in each corner but it flexes a bit in the middle if you press hard enough. It would have been nice to put at least one rubber foot in the middle... but this is really no big deal.* It comes with a nice felt (or felt-like) carrying bag.* I tested it with my Dell Venue 8 Pro (Windows 8.1) and an Andoid smartphone and had no issues.* Claims an uninterrupted working time of about 100 hours and a standby time of over 100 days.I can't really find anything negative to say about this keyboard except for the minor quibble about wanting more rubber feet... so I'm giving it 5 stars. It's my favorite Bluetooth keyboard if you don't count the fancy Logitech one I have that cost much more.NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.","05 21, 2014",A1T1YSCDW0PD25,A.

Tonight I did a firmware update, which reminded me that I haven't reviewed it yet.Things I've noticed:1.  There's a bunch of buttons near the top of the remote for selecting which input you're using.  On the left side of the remote is a button marked &#34;receiver&#34;.  In order to do anything on the receiver, you need to press the receiver button so that the remote knows to send signals to the receiver.  It seems silly, but I spend an awfully long time trying to figure out why I couldn't get the on screen menu to respond.PROs:1.  6 HDMI inputs. Granted I'm only using one input to feed signals from a Home Theatre PC, but it's good to have expandabiltiy.2.  Self measuring room equalization.  This required a little tweaking of levels when it was done, but that's pretty normal.  I'm pretty particular about matching levels between the speakers and the subwoofer.3.  Plenty of power for the speakers.  Since I have a powered subwoofer, the 5 highpass speakers got plenty of power.  If you're not running a subwoofer, you might have issues with bass sounds clipping the amp.4.  The remote works quite well, with a pretty good layout. I've programmed the orange button in the middle of the left side to power on/off the ceiling mounted projector.CONS:1.  Other reviewers have written at length about how Zone 2 can only user certain types of input source material.2.  Various clicks/thumps/delays when switching sources.3.  Firmware updates don't work over wifi, only by wired ethernet or USB stick.As you can tell, I don't really have much negative to say about it... it works for controlling the volume, powers my speakers, flattens out the room response curve, and just plain works.

That is, you could use it with any computer, video game, TV, radio, MP3 player or other device with a headphone jack.You do need a cable with a 1/8&#34; (3.5mm) male stereo plug on each end.  This is not supplied with the amp, but is available from Amazon or other vendors.My only minor gripe is that there is no power switch, so you have to unplug the wall transformer to turn it off.

Pleasantly surprised, this Fosmon (never heard of the company before) case improves the overall look the my Nexus 7 FHD.One thing to note, this will ONLY FIT THE 2013 NEXUS 7.Cut outs are spot on. No port is obstructed, no speaker is covered up, and unlike some other cases I've used, the headphone jack isn't overprotected, so larger 3.5mm cased headphone plugs won't have much trouble with fitment, as well as the micro USB port.Power button as well as the volume rocker are covered up, allowing easy to find embossed locations.Construction feels very sturdy. It was a tight fit getting it on properly, but the end result makes it feel like part of the tabet. It really does feel like it will provide ample protection against dings and short falls. I particularly like the clear bezel and frosted back. It makes the Nexus 7 look much more modern and classy. It's also cool being able to see the &#34;nexus&#34; logo through the case. The back of the case (frosted portion, which is the entire back), is a little slippery, but not enough that it would slide on a whim.If you do have a front screen shield (mine in particular is from Bodyguardz), you'll be happy to know this case is a perfect companion for it. It seems like the measurement of the screen guard matches perfectly to where the outer bezel of the case ends. I also had a back protector too and thought I could get away with leaving it on, but it just wouldn't work; the case fits so snug, that it wouldn't fit properly with that less than .04 mm thick shield on.Overall, loving this case!

They give you a mini battery and transmitter that will replace either a AA or AAA battery in your remote control.  When you use your remote, the transmitter (which is now in your remote's battery compartment) sends a signal to the quite small flying saucer looking thing which you put by the item you want to control.

Slower, but that's a real world number.3. As others have mentioned, everything is snappier, including web browsing, Large file loading/parsing for video editing has improved about 100%.4. I also went from 4gB to 8gB of RAM and re-tested. No real speed difference, though it will be handy for editing.Conclusion: Get an SSD before you increase RAM, unless you have some really pressing need for RAM. (I'm not a gamer.) This laptop, late 2011 vintage, was not slow, but is now very noticeably quicker, to the point where upgrading to faster laptop is pushed back for me. The OEM drive was a 512 GB 7200 RPM Seagate Momentus, which, like the WD Black series I've used, is pretty fast. The 840 Pro puts them both in the weeds.","07 9, 2014",A391R9E9C6UU5X,HD Video guy,Serious performance improvement on a quad-core laptop.,1404864000

B00FSKQNEY,Electronics,"[0, 1]",4,"I received this speaker through Amazon Vine to review, so I did not have a choice on color.  Had I a choice, I would have selected black because the white shows dirt way to easily.  Not usually an issue unless the device is meant to be portable and used all over the place (which is how I use it).Overall, I really enjoy the functionality and the sound from this speaker.  As spring is just kicking off, I've been using this speaker outside as I've have been doing work around the house.  It sounds incredible at mid to really loud levels.  An amusing side story..  I was testing the speaker outside on a nice sunny day and got into a discussion about hawks and eagles with a friend.  I have an Audubon Birds app on my phone, so I was playing the sound of hawks very loudly through the speaker.  After that, we looked up and there was a single bird moving or flying in any of the trees in my back yard. At all.  A testament to the quality and volume of sound for this speaker.Even at low volumes I did not have any issues with this speaker.  The sound was clear and smooth.  Possibly not as crisp as it could have been, still very good.There are some concerns I have with the speaker...- Buttons - wish there was more tactical feel for a button press.  Since there is a slight delay in the response to the volume buttons, it can be annoying to use the buttons.- DLNA - Configuring the DLNA was not intuitive.  I am still not sure if I got it working right.  Airplay and Bluetooth were easy.  I usually focus on Bluetooth anyway.- iPhone App - the App looked nice (turns out, like lipstick on a pig), but using it was non-intuitive and a PAIN in the butt.  SPEND MORE TIME ON DEVELOPING YOUR APPS!  This is a common problem.  Companies spend all their time developing their cool product and then do a phone app as an afterthought.  Since this device can do all kinds of things beyond the buttons on the device... your app suddenly becomes your primary interface to the device.  Treat the app that way.  (-1 star)Price... I think if HK wants to product to take off, the price will need to come down.  Truly I like the product... have enjoyed using it and look forward to using it.  Still..  I doubt I'd purchase it at the current price.Overall... as a product, love my HK portable speaker.","04 27, 2014",A30UP2KKD5IQEP,Soar,Great speaker to do projects with,1398556800

I think I could actually walk around with the compact camera attached, but the DSLR was heavy enough that I would want to unscrew it when not in use. When the camera is attached you're basically locked into a landscape shot, but I found that in a pinch I could brace the end against a wall, or the pole under my arm for a portrait shot if needed.At this price point, it's an easy purchase to add some stability to your shots when it's needed.","02 21, 2014",A2DKA8PMGZFXME,J.

B00AWLEAH6,Electronics,"[6, 6]",5,"Arrived in a very elegant package, this &#34;waterline&#34; labeled RE-400 model looked very sharp. Just like with HM700/RE-400B, a lot of attention was paid to presentation of the product to the point where they actually had to include the storage hard zippered case with extra eartips in a separate bag so it doesn't interfere with a slim profile of the original RE-400 package. The headphones were sitting inside of a felt lined foam insert with cutouts for extra eartips. Furthermore, more eartips were included with a storage case. When it comes to accessories, HiFiMAN never disappoints. In addition to headphones and storage case, they included 3 pairs of bi-flange eartips, 2 pairs of smaller black silicon tips, 3 custom shape clear silicone tips, 2 pairs of T-400 Comply premium foam tips (large and medium size), 5 pairs of filters, and a shirt clip. Though I can tell you ahead these headphones sound amazing, the right selection of eartips is VERY important to bring out the best in sound and isolation. I have a rather large ear canal and always use the largest included tip, where the custom shaped clear one provided the best passive noise isolation I ever experienced with any of in-ears.The first thing you notice when you take these headphones out - how super lightweight and compact they are. The barrel of these earpieces is made out of lightweight aluminum material and has a great ergonomics to fit comfortably inside of your ear. The barrel opening is covered by a cloth material filter (5 replacement pairs included), and right next to the strain relief there is a pinhole port for sound shaping. Followed by a decent strain relief the cables use a durable shiny rubber coating up until the y-splitter. Included chin slider moves very smoothly and made out of the same aluminum material. After y-splitter, the cable has a &#34;shoe lace&#34; type of cloth material cover which is still very durable and doesn't have that annoying springy effect found with so many other cables. The cable is terminated by a gold plated 3.5mm angled connector with a flexible strain relief. I also noticed microphonics effect was down to minimum.When it comes to sound quality, RE-400 delivers amazing results! This single dynamic driver in-ear really focuses to deliver a neutral transparent sound but unlike other neutral headphones that sound lifeless - these are very smooth and warm. The sound is not in your face, it's a few steps back, but it sounds very natural without any artificial enhancement. The characteristics that surprised me the most was the low end where neutral headphones usually try hard to show details but lack the extension. Here, you still get a very detailed bass sound without any humps, but it actually extends beyond mid-bass punch down to some sub-bass texture. It's not enhanced or boosted, just perfect to enjoy your low frequencies, well controlled without spilling into mids. I found bass to be not as fast in comparison to my other headphones, but it's very well rounded and full. Mids are very detailed, clear, maybe a bit forward but not too much. The vocals sound very natural and lush. High frequency (treble) is extended, detailed, bright but not harsh and without any hint of sibilance. Upper mids/treble is very well controlled and just perfect for extended listening period without ear fatigue. The soundstage is average, not too wide which was definitely a step back from RE-400B balanced version that had an amazing 3D width. But this is in-line with other similar IEMs, while balanced wiring/architecture is intended to widen the sound. The headphones were really easy to drive from my phone and X5, but I did notice I had to dial in a higher volume level to enjoy them more.Overall, I knew that I will not be disappointed with RE-400, and my testing just solidified that! No matter what genre of music you are listening to, these headphones will guarantee to bring out the best in every song. The sound has just a perfect balance of neutral natural tones without going into any extreme. Perhaps if you are a basshead craving for a more bass impact or need an analytical bright set of headphones - these might not be your cup of tea. But as all around headphones that sounds and looks great, and has a very reasonable pricing in comparison to other single and multi-driver IEMs in the sound sound category - these deserve a serious consideration.","05 11, 2014",A2DKQQIZ793AV5,Twister,Amazing sound quality!!!,1399766400

B00HNFPZF0,Electronics,"[0, 0]",5,"First of all - I am hard on my equipment.  I am often in harsh conditions and like to have my iPad with me because I keep almost everything I need during the day on it.  While I take very good care of my equipment, I need to be confident that I am not going to damage my expensive electronics.What this case is not &#8212; it is not waterproof, it is water resistant.  I have had a number of so called waterproof cases, and they all have failed at some point.  I prefer the water resistant cases as they do not give you a false sense that you are protected.  The front of this case is pretty well sealed, but the back does have some open places water can enter.  I feel confident it will protect against light rain and spray, which will account for 99% of the environment where one would try to use an iPad.What this case is - expendable.  When you think about the money invested in an iPad, you want to ensure it lasts.  This case will eventually wear out, get dropped, have the face significant scratched, etc - and that is exactly what you want to happen.  Given this case costs less than 5% of my iPad, let it takes the falls and protect your precious investment.Now on the the good and not as good &#8212;Good - The case seems well protected and durable.  The outer rubber shell is stiff and feels very durable.  It is a smoother type rubber, not the &#8220;sticky&#8221; rubber that attracts lint and dirt.  The home button is well protected and has a very solid feel underneath the protective case.  All of the ports are still accessible, including the charge port - which is often too small for some aftermarket charge cords, but not in this case.  The protective screen is solid and clear, it shows no signs of bubbling underneath.  I like the case stand - it is metal and is very sturdy to hold up the device.Not as good - two concerns with the leather strap.  First of all, it is difficult to adjust to a smaller size.  Second, as I got the leather strap wet it held water for quite some time.  While it looks very nice and feels rugged, I am not sure it would not be better with some other type of syntactic material.Neither good nor bad - just part of having a case.  This is not a case you will want to take your iPad in and out of often.  Once it goes in, you will want to leave it is not easy removing and will weaken the case over time.  You also have to get used to the protective screen surface.  it is slightly less &#8220;smooth&#8221; when using, but typical of all screen protectors and still very usable.Overall I would recommend.","03 21, 2014",A3HJ4G86F2AKEA,Terry Fischer,Good protection / great price value,1395360000

Currently upgrading SSD to a 480GB model (which for the price, this one should have been that large).  i5 keeps things speedyNOTE: If you go to upgrade this model's SSD, make sure you do so with an mSATA hard drive (looks like a circuit board).  I will tell you that they say there are two hard drives setup in RAID 0 but that is absolutely not the case (at least for mine).  I had a single 120GB drive inside.  I'm glad I looked before buying two drives...Battery life: ~1-3 hrs depending on load.  Extended battery adds about 2-4 hrs.  Basically is just goes into the same jack as the power cable and then you rotate it to snap onto the back.  Two little screws tighten into the bottom and it's secured.  Just be careful as it's easy to torque the battery and damage the power jack.  I would recommend not connecting it unless absolutely necessary.Peripherals:  Only 2 usb 3.0 ports but thanks to a bluetooth mouse, this isn't likely a problem.  Still, would have to rely on buying a 4 port hub to allow for additional devices.  Keyboard buttons seem fine, I like the chiclet style and it's backlit well.  The display adapter is a micro HDMI.  They were smart to include an adapter dongle that plugs into this, but only for VGA.  I don't know why they didn't include a micro-&#62;HDMI, considering that's what most monitors use anymore.  You'll likely need to spend another $10 to get this adapter.  There's also a USB adapter for a CAT5 ethernet cable in case you only have access to a hardline for internet.  Useful in niche situations I suppose.Screen: Clear and bright, about what you'd expect.  Also it's touch.  If you're not used to it, it takes a little practice, but definitely makes sense with Windows 8.  Obviously not very large.Sound:  OK, considering speaker size.  Loud enough for most situations.  Use headphones if it's too loud elsewhere.Finish:  Feels solid yet very light and compact.  Nice brushed metal finish.  Product is misrepresented.  Will NOT open to 178 degrees unless you break it.  135-140 TOPS.  Probably not a huge issue for some, but not what is advertised.  Fan noise is very low until it kicks up the processor.

I needed something strong for use a few times each week in local travel and it came down to this Davis and Sanford model vs. its closest competitors (Fancier Studio 270a and Ravelli AVTP).  I chose this one because I needed more height than the other two offer (note they all have the bowl mount - not the crank up center piece - very important for quick leveling). I'm 6'4"" and am very comfortable viewing through the camera even with the legs spread out all the way --- lens height maybe 5'10"" or more (guessing). It also seemed to be more beefy where the leg extentions are concerned.  I assume all the heads are good, but can say this FM18 head is a dream to use. It is extraordinarilly smooth and can be locked securely if needed.I do not have the other tripods to compare, but can say without reservation that this was a very, very good choice and incredible value.  By the way, there has been some confusion about what the ""XB"" in the model means...I have no idea. The leg decal just has branding and says ""7518B."" This model came with the nice carrying bag, two plates, both 3/8 and 1/4 interchangeable mounting screws etc; it is 100% complete. Maybe the ""X"" part means it does not have the dolly. Beats me.

B006PWGEVQ,Electronics,"[1, 1]",2,"The good:A decent case if you want to take out the tablet by itself. It has a magnetic latch in addition to the fold-over sort of strap that you often see on Ipad cases. Memory card slots are nice and snug, though it's hard to say how they would hold up to repeated use. It can also be used as a stand if you're just using it for the tablet, though it only provides a single angle.The holes seem to line up with all the inputs and speakers decently.The bad:It's not the easiest thing to get bound onto the T100, and so when you do, you might be reluctant to remove it again. Considering that it's a detachable machine, that could wind up being a problem for some people. Another problem is that attaching or detaching the screen while it stays in the binding is difficult, and can force some awkward positions that may lead to sloppy/incomplete connections (in an attachment scenario). This was a serious disappointment for me, as I had hoped that I might be able to detach it within the case and flip it over to use as a tablet.Another problem is that the straps that hold the screen in place can get in the way of your swipes for the charms bar or app screen if you're holding it in landscape.

I liked it from the beginning, but held off reviewing it because of some reviewers comments that it did not hold up under use. This has not been my experience. I looks as good and functions as well today as it did the first day I got it.The best thing about this case is how well it works as a stand for watching video. I think it works better than any other case I have used that features the same &#34;cover folded into a triangle&#34; stand mode. There is a magnet in the lip of the foldable cover, that besides being used to wake and sleep the tablet, helps secure the cover when folded into stand mode.For me, the second best thing is how easy it is to remove the tablet from the case. When I am using the tablet at home for reading, I prefer going caseless, and this case makes it very easy to do that. It is also very easy to replace the tablet in the case when I am done. I also haven't noticed that repeated removal and replacement of the case has caused the case to fit the tablet less well.My only complaint about the case is that both the power button and the volume rocker are a little harder to use when the case is on.

Still, I was willing to try out another case, especially when it retails for half the price of the Origami.Two things jumped out for me when I first saw theTek-nical Case by Incipio: there's an elastic band to hold the Kindle Fire HDX in place and there are no magnets, which on the Origami allows me to automatically turn off my Kindle Fire HDX when I close it.It isn't realistic to expect either the Tek-nical Case or the Origami Case to save the Kindle Fire HDX from a 10-foot drop onto concrete. In our household, the cases are used to protect the screen from spills and scratches. So, the Tek-nical Case lack of functions really puts it behind the Origami Case.CONS:* The Tek-nical Case is only stable for landscape hands-free viewing.

Plug and Play, works and fits very well with latest iPod 6th generation tiny Nano, iPod Touch 4th generation, iPhone 4 and iPad. Bluetooth iPod Adapter. (Electronics)I've wished for many years that iPod was Bluetooth. So imagine my happiness to find this little Kokkia BT dongle!! Yes, happy.I just purchased this lovely Kokkia i10s Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter, and have the awesome LG HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset. I have a iPod Classic 160 GB. I had a little trouble pairing it on my own, so I went to www dot Kokkio dot com/faq/i10spairingconnecting dot html to help me pair it and I paired it instantly following the easy directions.ORHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAIRING EITHER ANY BLUETOOTH ""iDEVICE"" to any BT compatible; RECEIVER, CAR RADIO, SPEAKER OR HEADSET:Please refer to below steps (in the steps an iDevice = iPod or iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch):1) First make sure your iDevice battery, and your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker battery are charged.2) a) Power OFF your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker.2) b) Turn OFF the Bluetooth of any other Bluetooth devices (including the native Bluetooth of any iPhone or iPad or iPod Touch, etc).This step is very important, as other Bluetooth devices will connect to any previously paired/connected device if they are not disabled, causing the i10s not to be able to pair/connect to your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker.3) Power ON the iDevice (make sure the iDevice LCD screen is lighted up at this step), the i10s is NOT plugged into iDevice at this step.4) Put your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker into pairing mode (check your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker user guide for how to put your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker in pairing mode).5) Insert the i10s into iDevice. After several seconds, the blue led on i10s will start to quick flash.6) When the i10s and your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver are paired and connected the i10s blue LED will slow flash once in every ~5 secs7) If you don't hear any music on Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker, check to make surea. iDevice is not in pause mode. If in pause mode, change to play modeb. iDevice volume is not at minimum - move the volume control on iDevice to make sure volume changes and not at minimum.c. Your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker volume is not at minimum, if at minimum - increase your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker volume.8) If unsuccessful, remove i10s from iDevice. Power off your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker. Repeat steps 1 to step 7 again. If fail 3 times, steps 1-7, let us know.The LG headset controls my iPod Classic very well. I believe to choose another album to play on iPod, you would have to do that on the iPod itself. However, with my headset I can control volume, FF to next song or Reverse to last song or go back to beginning of album by several presses of the Back Reverse button on my headset. Now I am motivated to plan out more LONG playlists on my iPod. Yeah!!Other reviewers have said to put iPod volume at maximum, this was too loud for me on my LG headset's lowest setting, SO I put the iPod volume at just a bit above 1/2 level, and now volume control on headset goes from a nice low but well heard volume to just 5 or 6 clicks of headphone up volume button takes me right into the WAY TOO LOUD level.ALSO, I do know that volume setting when higher does deplete the iPod battery life quite a bit faster. So, half way for me works nicely. So if this helps save battery power and iPod battery lasts longer, YAY!UPDATE ON MY EXPERIMENT: My iPod BATTERY LIFE EXPERIMENT WITH KOKKIO BT DONGLE: I started playing my iPod Classic 160GB On Friday 2/7/14 at 5:18 pm. Stopped play at 10:03pm = 4.75 hoursSaturday: started at 11:00am, stopped at 5:42 pm. = 6 hr 42 min.TOTAL = 11 hr 16 minHOWEVER, I did leave the Kokkio dongle plugged into iPod on Friday evening, iPod battery level was about 70%, BUT when I restarted iPod Saturday at 11am, battery level was at about 40% on my iPod.Conclusion, possibly the Kokkia Dongle draws power from iPod battery if left plugged in even though it's not BT connected to anything.I will redo my experiment again on full batteries, early in the day so I don't have to interrupt it for sleep.Then another day I will leave Kokkia Dongle plugged into iPod when it's fully charged to see if there is battery drainage by the end of the day.EXPECT AN UPDATE.I placed my iPod with the Kokkia BT dongle inserted, and placed it on the kitchen breakfast bar which is central in my home 1980sq.ft. and I'm able to walk throughout my home without any cutting out. So range for me is good.Battery info, just a FYI re my experiences. As an ex Electronic Test technician, I tend to discharge ALL batteries that are rechargeable totally and completely, then give the item-battery a full charge without interruption. (I have one of the first hard drive mp3 players, Rio Riot, that is 13 years old, that still carries a charge for about 14 hours. I still have it and it works.) RC car enthusiasts use a lightbulb to drain their batteries before recharging them for this very same reason. I do NOT believe there is NO battery memory problems with NiMH batteries like what was known on NiCad rechargeables back many years ago.iPod CASE and this Kokkio: I had researched iPod cases, as most of my clothing does not have pockets available, so I need a belt clip case. I did find a nice protective case that I might want that does hook to your waistband or belt. This is the case: http://www.amazon.com/CrazyOnDigital-Premium-Leather-Classic-Package-Black/dp/B002AF5184/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topHowever, my issue/questions was whether the Kokkio BT dongle would fit into the case fully. Now that I have the Kokkia dongle in my iPod, see that the Kokkia BT dongle is actually a little bit smaller and has very smooth rounded edges compared to the charging plug/cord USB for iPod, and there is a cutout in the case to fit the charge plug. SO, I feel that this Kokkia BT dongle will fit fine with this or any other iPod case you might want to purchase because all of them have the cutout for the charging cord. .I DO UPDATE ALL my reviews as needed on ALL electronics goodies, also after 6 months and then again about a year after purchase and use, so if a few years goes by without an update, it's still working fine. LOL, or I died. But I do have many years left if life goes to plan.","02 8, 2014",A30YP1B6XWP3S4,"Retired ""Retired, and enjoying my free time. ...","Pairing Instructions in my Review.

The camera, lenses, and countless other electronics were all in tact! I'm sure theSilica Gel packI used was also a factor in this.I am very impressed with this case. I've stood on it to get higher shots, dragged it up and down stairs, and generally handle it in a carefree manner (It IS fairly heavy).

Side by side photos on the screen look the same (d50 is 6.0 megapixel). Printed there is probably a difference. However, this camera is much faster in burst mode and also shoots video, which is why I got it. What I miss is the internal motor for AF on older lenses, but I can handle focusing manually. Non AF-S lenses are (mostly) still compatible, which is why I like Nikon. I don't have any complaints, it just wasn't the step up from the D50 that I had imagined. Video quality is OK, I wish I could get 60 FPS on the highest resolution. I've had it for nearly two years and it still functions perfectly and I have even dropped it once (the lens also still functions perfectly but the plastic casing didn't survive.)

First the installation of the iPad into the case is very simple, just line it up with the correct orientation and just push it in place until the sides click into position. Once the iPad is installed it can then rotate 360 degrees to view in landscape or portrait view.  The side of the case that sits up against the screen has a soft, felt-like material so as to be very good at not scratching your screen.  Some of the material (be it vinyl or leather-like) on the blue and white part has some wrinkles around the corner of the case, however this is not a deal breaker as it's not peeling or coming off in any way it just shows that it's not something that is of perfect quality.  AS for the closing of the case, I have not experienced any of the indicated problems that others may have had with the magnets not shutting the screen off.  I have tested it and it takes about a quarter to half and inch of separation before the screen will come back on.  One thing I have noticed, if you set your iPad down and don't use the elastic band, just make sure you set it down with the large red part on the bottom and the iPad screen facing downward, that way the weight of the iPad will force itself as close to the red part of the case with the magnet in it.  With the elastic band securing the iPad to the red portion, We have had no problems setting it down in any orientation.

B00J49ZH6K,Electronics,"[162, 171]",5,"Finally received my Samsung Chromebook 2 (11.6"" version, jet black color) and have had a day to get it set up, mess around with it, and compare it to myAcer C720 Chromebook (2GB), as well as my previous experiences with the originalSamsung Chromebookthat was released back in 2012. My initial up front experience is that I am overall very satisfied with the improvements that Samsung has made! There are some areas I wish they improved, but overall for the price, this is an outstanding way to experience the Chrome OS. I'll touch on a few of my in-depth thoughts below, and I'll update this all in the future as I have more experience with the device. I'm going to focus more on the hardware and less on the operating system or software, since the OS will remain fairly consistent across all Chromebook devices and plenty of information already exists about Chrome OS online:Design/Materials/Build Quality: As mentioned above, I went with the jet black version. This new Chromebook 2 features Samsungs ""stitched leather"" design to the outside of the top shell, similar to what you see if you have ever used their Galaxy Note 3. It stands out a lot more when you see it spread across a much larger device like this. I'm going to be honest, I think some people are going to find this slightly tacky looking/feeling (especially the fake stitching around the edges), but personally I am a much bigger fan of it than I thought. For a computing device in this price range, you cannot really expect them to be able to throw on a full aluminum/metal case like you might find on a MacBook Pro or a higher end Ultrabook laptop. You're going to get something that is plastic or a more cost effective material, and honestly, I kind of like the way that this faux-leather design makes it stand out from other devices. And the overall build quality of the Chromebook 2 feels much improved over the original. It doesn't have as much ""flex"" to it, and even though it is still almost entirely plastic-based, it certainly feels like a step up. Also, compared to my Acer C720 side by side, the Samsung CB2 feels significantly higher in quality.Display: My Chromebook 2 is the 11.6"" model. This is one of the very few areas where I am finding myself wishing that Samsung would have improved this new model, even if it came at a slight cost increase. The resolution on the 11.6"" model is only 1366x768, which is the same as you'll find on pretty much every other Chromebook aside from the Pixel (which is way too expensive), and the upcoming 13"" version of the Chromebook 2 (which will more to a full HD 1920 screen). I'm actually OK with the resolution topping out at only 1366x768 on a screen of this size, but they are still using a TN-based panel when I think that they should have stepped it up to an IPS panel and really made it stand out. It's about on par with the screen on my Acer C720, doesn't feel like much of an improvement. I wouldn't consider myself too overly picky, but side by side with a device with an IPS panel, and the screen on the Chromebook 2 just looks kind of dull and washed out in comparison. According to the specs I've seen, even the 13"" version of the Chromebook 2 is going to have a TN panel (just in higher resolution), so I wouldn't be surprised to hear more people complaining about this aspect.Processor/RAM: The Chromebook 2 utilizes one of Samsung's own ARM-based chips, called the ""Exynos 5 Octa 5420"", which is rated at 1.9GHz. Most of the computing experiences in my life outside of smartphone use have been with either an Intel or an AMD processor; even my trusty Acer C720 Chromebook uses an Intel Celeron-based processor. I was a little hesitant to make the jump to a newer generation of Chromebook without an Intel processor since I know Acer is going to soon release a variant of the C720 with an Intel i3 chip. However, so far, I am quite impressed with how quick this Exynos 5 Octa chip has felt through normal use. I haven't run any actual benchmarking programs or applications (if someone has a suggestion, I'll be glad to try one, if they even exist for Chrome OS?), but directly comparing it side-by-side to the Acer C720 running on the 1.4GHz Celeron processor, this is no comparison. Apps load much more instantly on the new Chromebook 2, but the biggest difference can be seen when using anything that involves video. Doing a Google Hangout on my older Chromebook was always slightly laggy enough that it was moderately frustrating, especially when trying to multi-task during a hangout. That lag has seemingly disappeared with this new model, and in all honesty, I haven't found a task yet where I've been wishing that it was faster than it is now. This may also partially be aided by the fact that the Chromebook 2 has 4gb of RAM, versus my Acer C720 which only has 2gb, and my previous experiences with the original Chromebook 1 which also only had 2gb. Either way, the improvement in speed has been fantastic and you will certainly notice it.Keyboard/Touchpad: This is one of the most important things to me on any computing device I own. Nothing is more frustrating than a keyboard with a weird design or layout that becomes a permanent hassle for the life of the device. Luckily, this might be the BEST overall feature of the Chromebook 2. Normally when I get a new device, I find myself needing a period of adjustment as I get used to the feel of a new keyboard, new keys, new layout. I found myself instantly loving the feel and use of the keyboard on the Chromebook 2. The keys feel sturdy and solid, and the spacing feels very natural between keys. The keys themselves have a very natural ""curved"" feel to the top of them that yields a very pleasant typing experience. Honestly the best possible comment that I think I can give an input device is that it feels so natural and correct that you immediately stop thinking about it once you start using it, and that is the case here. I didn't have many complaints about the keyboard on my Acer C720, but I can definitely say that the keyboard on this Chromebook 2 is noticeably improved and Samsung did a great job here. The touchpad itself is pleasantly wide (wider than the spacebar!) and feels accurate and smooth. Overall I can say without a doubt that this is the best keyboard and touchpad I've used on any Chromebook device to date outside of the Pixel.Hard Drive/Storage: My 11.6"" Chromebook 2 came with a 16gb solid-state hard drive, only a little over half of which is actually accessible by the user to use as storage. Everyone has different needs so opinions will vary on this, but one of the main draws of Google OS and the Chromebooks are how well they function as cloud devices. Other than space used to install apps, which for the most part are very small (20mb or less in size), almost everything else I use my Chromebooks for can be performed from the cloud or require very little onboard storage. There are many options available to store files, pictures, data on the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc), so I honestly don't think the storage space is going to be much of an issue for most people. Plus, being that it is a solid-state drive, it is VERY fast compared to traditional hard drives in terms of accessing files and data; also, since solid state drives have no moving parts inside, a lot more stable and damage proof for lugging it around on-the-go. Unless you are going to be installing literally hundreds of apps (most people probably only regularly use two dozen or less), or unless you regularly need to work where you have no internet access at all for extended periods of time, I  think the size of the drive will suffice.Battery: This is a section I will need to update further in the future. Samsung is claiming 8 hours of battery life on a full charge. I haven't noticed anything yet that would lead me to believe this claim is false, but I also haven't owned it long enough to go through a full charge from start to finish. I'll update my thoughts on this after I have run a few full cycles through the battery.Speakers: I'll be honest, I don't personally use the built-in speakers a ton on any laptop or device I've owned. I'm typically either just using this for web browsing or productivity, but when I do listen to music with it, I've found myself using Bluetooth to connect to external Bluetooth speakers in the past (namely my Logitech Boombox or my Jawbone Jambox if I am on the go). I did test the speakers out for a while though on my Chromebook 2, and I have to say I am fairly impressed. Considering that the speakers are located on the bottom of the device, I was surprised at how well they projected sound. And considering their tiny size, they were able to get louder than I expected while remaining fairly clear. I wouldn't expect booming base from these, but they don't sound ""tinny"" either and have a decent balance to them. I'll still probably stick to using my Bluetooth speakers when I want to blast music around my house or when working outdoors, but I can't see the built-in speakers disappointing anyone who came in with reasonable expectations.Other features: I'll come back to this and add to my review once I have had more time with the unit. Webcam, software, pictures, any other likes or dislikes that I find as I continue to use it further beyond the first few days.Overall, this is a great product, especially when you factor in the value that you get for the money. If I could give it partial stars, I'd give it about a 4.6/5 (and the only deduction would really be because I wish they had upgraded the screen further). It's very very quick in everyday use; boots up almost instantly from sleep (or about 10 total seconds if you shut it off completely), gets very solid battery life, and ChromeOS allows you to easily do almost any normal computing task that you would normally do with Apple OS or Windows. It's very lightweight and portable, and the build quality is solid. If you come in expecting this to perform like a $1000+ i7 Ultrabook or a MacBook Pro, you might leave disappointed. But other than that, especially at a price point of just over $300 at launch, I feel like the Chromebook 2 is not only going to sell a lot of new customers on the Chrome OS, but offer a very noticeable speed and function upgrade to people who are using previous generation Chromebook models. If you have only used traditional laptops your whole life and this is your first experience into Chrome OS, your mind is going to be blown when you first realize that you are INSTANTLY at the desktop and ready to go when you open the laptop up from sleep mode. I will revisit my review and update it further as time passes and I notice new things to comment on. Anything you want me to review that I missed, let me know in the comments and I'll come back and add my thoughts.","05 15, 2014",AB0ZI13CLWPL6,"Dangs ""Dan""",A solid upgrade from the last generation of Chromebook models,1400112000

But I am disappointed with this item and looking straight into replacing it after just 2 months of use.I was using Windows notebooks for most of my computing life till 2 years back when I need a light weight notebook of 2.5 Kg or below, minimum of 16GB and a Quad-core i7 notebook (I do development works and my works are mostly out of country). I ended up with Macbook pro (retina) and that is the only machine at that time that met this requirement (shame on Wintel). Fast forward now and I am looking for a same high computing power, touch screen, lighter notebook cum tablet running Win8.1. I ended up with this item after all the great reviews here and elsewhere.At the point of purchase, I accepted the following facts:1. It is only be 8GB,2. It has the yellow display problem,but:1. It is light weight2. It is flexible and able to twist into a tablet3. It is touch screen4. Reasonably price (ps. not low price)However, after just two months of usage. I reverted back to Macbook Pro for most of my usage because this item has too many design faults because Lenovo is using mostly low quality components beyond the aspect of looks.Let me highlight bellow and I these are unlikely to be a one-off problem that you might think.1. Distorted yellow colour display problem remain unresolved with the latest BIOS upgrade - Yes, despite claims from some websites, the problem is here. See it for yourself, just run MS Paint program and look at the yellow in the colour menu and compare it with the next unit in the showroom and you will know what I meant. Gee.. why give you a 3200 x 1800 ultra high resolution when you cannot even display basic colour correctly?2. Only 1 mini-HDMI (faulty) display - my job required frequent presentation. The mini-HDMI port design so poorly that most mini-HDMI cables cannot have a good contact to receive signal. 90% of the time, you are unable to display unless you make some cuttings to the cable and risk damaging them and still not working, I brought 3 cables and followed the instructions most other owners suggested and managed to get one cable to work. And this is after I stacked some objects below the connecting part to cause the connector to tilt upward (It is too complex to explain here without a diagram here but you can surely do a search on the Internet, especially the Lenovo owner forum,  to understand what I mean)3. To mitigate the above, I thought of a &#8220;wise&#8221; idea to overcome this shortcoming - Invest in a wireless display (Widi) since this unit supposed to support Widi. Widi allow you to connect to a projector remotely via a USB port and that perhaps can solve my problem.  I bought a Netgear PTV3000 Wireless Display Adapter. This adapter works with every of my WIDI compatible devices except Yoga 2 pro. Once again, after searching in the forum, I realise this is a design issue4. Wifi - After wasted many days of testing, I realised that this unit cannot run the dual-band WIFI 802.11n network. it will only accept the 2.4GHz band but not the faster 5GHz band and this was again confirmed by many other owners. Goodness me, when the new Macbook Air release much earlier, it uses the latest 802.11ac and my 4 years old ASUS notebook support dual-band without any problem. Beside this, moving further away from the router, my 1.5 years-old Samsung S4 connected on the same 2.4G wifi router running about 3 times faster that this notebook; I was speechless.So, my experience with this unit has been that the more you use it, the more problems you will uncover, and probably to the extent that you will end up putting it a side as a white-elephant or for my case, using it to play some youtube videos which can be done using my home TV set too.","05 1, 2014",A2Y2GKU7GJZGJL,berthan,Please do more research before you purchase,1398902400

The earphones fit comfortably and were effective in keeping out all but the loudest ambient noise. The ear tips that came on the set were comfortable for my ears, but there were six other sets of varying sizes and firmness, so virtually any user should be able to find a good fit. Hard-wired earphones like these don't give the freedom of movement that Bluetooth earphones have, but the tradeoff is that there's no internal battery to keep charged, and you don't have to worry about drop-outs when you're moving around.I used the M5 earphones with a playlist of songs that gave them a good workout. I first used a couple of utility MP3s (Channel Balance Test and Stepped Stereo Pan Test) to check the stereo channel balance and stereo separation, and the earphones passed with flying colors. I don't claim to be an expert audiophile, but to my ear, the sound was at least as good as any earphones that I've used, including Bluetooth earphones.I'm also impressed with the accessories that came with the earphones. The six sets of different earbuds (plus the set that's on the earphones) are a very nice touch, plus a clip for hooking the audio cable to your shirt.

When I started my new delivery job, it became crystal clear to me I needed a GPS or else I would soon become unemployed. A friend loaned me the Garmin 1300 nuvi, and that was okay, but I wasn't really fond of typing in addresses, because that is very tedious when one is under time pressure to get somewhere.I sprang for the extra features in this model, namely voice recognition. Let me say that voice recognition is GREAT. Yes, it is worth the extra money, and you know what, to be honest, I'd pay $250 extra for it, if I had to. I don't feel like parking the car and typing on a crap touchscreen keyboard. To hell with that.The voice recognition software works like a charm, although I do have a pretty clear voice. If you have an accent or lisp, then you might want to factor that into your calculations, although maybe not. The unit does allow you to program your own, customized commands, so it can adapt to anybody's voice, as long as you're patient enough to program it once.One tip--once you enter an address and it finds it, you have to say &#34;Navigate!&#34; for it to start feeding you the directions. It's not automatic.Using my computer, I updated the software and the maps online using Garmin Express without any difficulty. I do wish Garmin Express worked on Linux, but I don't think it does.

Many by people who are just too lazy to read the description or understand a tablet or phone they spent hundreds of dollars on.IT'S A LIGHTNING ADAPTER!That means it won't work with older iPads and iPhones. It works with the ones that have the little Lightning plug, not the wider 30 pin plug.I waded through all the questions claiming it mirrors anything on my iPad or iPhone screen. I wanted a solution to use with TiVo. IT DOESNT WORK WITH TIVO! You can call TiVo, who makes an excellent DVR, but has unknowledgable support people, and they will tell you to call Apple to complain, because it is their design that prevents it from working. It is not! It is TiVo's. They choose to prevent it from working for whatever reason. Copyrights. Content providers. Marketing. Whatever.There is one solution currently for TiVo owners wanting to stream recordings or live TV to remote televisions. It is Slingbox. You can connect a Slingbox to your TiVo. Stream it to an iPad or iPhone. And then with this adapter (assuming of course, your device uses a Lightning plug), play it on a larger screen. (Also assuming you have an HDMI connection on your TV, and have an HDMI cable). You also have to purchase a $15 app for your iPhone or iPad.The other way to do it, without this adapter, is to use a Roku, or other streaming video player with a Slingbox. A caveat here is it doesn't work with iPads. Only iPhones (and some other smartphones). You need the Slingbox, Roku, iPhone (which can have any style plug, as long as it uses ios 6.1 or later), the Slingplayer app. And you have video from your home TiVo to anywhere you have a decent wifi connection.Despite the TiVo failure with this adapter, I'm keeping it, but for almost $50, and inability to truly mirror anything from an iPhone or iPad, it gets 3 stars.Hope this helps.","04 28, 2014",A3QNX5KWHDV0GD,"J.

B00BGA9WK2,Electronics,"[9, 11]",5,"Was never a fan of the Playstation mainly because of the controller. The overall shape and design never appealed to me. I transitioned from the Gamecube to the original xbox and was always a Xbox user. I tried many times to enjoy a Playstation console but could never get myself to like the dualshock controllers.In November I picked up the Xbox one and recently (May 2014) traded it in and switched to a PS4. The PS4 in my opinion is really targeted to gamers. The Xbox One is targeted to those who want an all around experience with games and entertainment. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my Xbox One but with the direction Microsoft is going, doubting its decision, downgrading the price, I wasn't having it. Microsoft really cheated its early adopter by dropping the price due to the lack of interest of the kinect. Followed by having customers buy adapters for headsets and a charging kit.In this review I'll will be comparing both systems in a number of categories and explain their pros and cons in my preference.*Design*At launch as mentioned earlier I picked up the Xbox One. The design never really bothered me but it was a very large machine. It took a lot of space on my tv stand because of its size, the power brick and kinect. After switching to the PS4, I can't believe what a difference there was. The PS4 took 1/3 less room on my TV stand and was thinner. It had a better sleek design and a much more appealing look. Lets be honest the Xbox One looks like a bulky cable box. When it comes to looks the PS4 takes the win for that category.With the history of the red ring microsoft ensured to keep their new system cool in which they achieved greatly. But the top fan would collect dust along the grill and I would constantly try to wipe away any build up which was really annoying. I did like how the Xbox One had many USB ports where as the PS4 has 2. The PS4 design is slim and stylish. I like the lit up line going through the system. My one complaint is the design in the back. Being diagonal it was a little annoying plugging things in because of the recessed ports due to the back pointing out, if that made sense.Both systems share their combinations of matte and glossy finishes but the PS4 has the better stylish design while still providing slightly better hardware.*Controller*As I mentioned earlier the controller was a big deal to me. I always preferred the Xbox controller because of the triggers and the position of the thumb sticks. The Xbox One controllers felt a little bigger but I liked the design, it might not seem like a huge feature but the impulse triggers were really nice and loved that feature. Problem is the Xbox one controller requires an additional adapter no matter what headset you're using unless you're using the stock headset. Also instead of running through batteries, they sell a charging kit. In total that's an extra $45 + tax. That is ridiculous, microsofts vision of a motion sensor should completely stop in my opinion. They could of easily never added the kinect and used the extra $100 to include a charging kit and adapter.With the PS4 at first I was skeptical because I feared I would not like the new Dual shock 4. But after playing with it at the store I've grown to like it a lot. I do like that they indented the thumb sticks because a big reason why I never liked the dual shock was because of the domed shape sticks. That's just my preference. Also the previous dual shock the L2 and R2 were weird to me because I prefer a trigger like button for shooters. They slightly changed the triggers on the DS4, it might not be a trigger like the xbox but it feels better in the hands. I love how the system came with a charging cable and any 3rd party headsets will work without any additions accessories! That was a big plus on Sony's part.Both controllers have their pros and cons, I still do favor the overall shape of the xbox controller but I am loving the Dual shock 4. I understand there have been complaints on the battery life on the Dual shock 4 but hopefully overtime quality control could change that. The quality and feel of the xbox one controller felt cheap, the plastic they used didn't seem up to par with the 360 controller. The PS4 controller really felt like a quality build.*User Interface*The Xbox Ones interface is pretty much a windows 8 appearance. The UI in my opinion was a huge step back because the UI was designed towards using voice command instead using the controller. I prefer using a controller to navigate. The Xbox One's UI is very slow in my opinion, its too flashy by having things pop in and out, a waste of load time, hiding things within category folders, and pushing what app was last used. I would constantly get frustrated in finding things and constantly closing applications. The 360's UI before the launch of the one was great. While microsoft are constantly updating its UI, its still not up to pair as a next gen in my opinion. Like the biggest complaint was checking storage space and battery life. Are you kidding me? Those two are almost standard in ANY DEVICE. The direction of the xbox UI was completely pulled back because they designed it with the kinect in mind.The PS4 design has a learning curve especially if you're coming from the xbox. But it is very simple and straight forward which I really liked. Essentially there are two home bars which hold specific icons. After sitting down getting used to the UI it is very responsive in my opinion. Things load quickily, I can easily find what I need whether it be settings, accounts, space, etc. I can easily see who's online unlike the xbox where I have to navigate through an annoying wall feed. The icons are small and titled where as the xbox have large boxes that take up space. Everything is right in front of you on the PS4 UI where the One has 3 sections. I just wished you could change the background or color of the PS4, unless I haven't noticed that feature. At times I find the blue a little too blended in with the white text.With the PS4 I experienced the UI at update 1.70? I believe so I can't compare the UI's from launch. Microsoft has been providing updates and announcements but its still not easily navigated on the PS4 in my opinion. The UI's for both systems will change overtime as we've seen from the last generation. Overall they both has their issues and needed updates but the PS4 gets my vote for my preference in navigation.*Gameplay + Visual*The Xbox One has slightly weaker hardware because their company, microsoft focuses on software. Comparing the multi-platform games the PS4 has a slight edge from what I've experienced.One of the best looking games Tomb Raider the Definitive Edition looks amazing both on the PS4 and Xbox One. But in my experience it ran smoother on the PS4. Multi-platform games will most likely run a higher setting on the PS4 because Sony is a hardware company and provided better parts into the system. The Xbox One could of been on the same level but included parts to compensate for their ""all in one"" media entertainment. I'm not saying one overpowers the other but their is a slight difference on the multi-platform games. What makes each console shine is their exclusives.Forza 5 was beautiful, the cars looked incredibly detailed and the sound was amazing. Forza 5 shows the Xbox One can compete graphically with the PS4. Another game which showed off its hardware was Dead Rising 3 which I heavily enjoyed. The amount of polygons (character models, zombies) was amazing. I really felt surrounded with a never ending crowd of zombies. It didn't run a high frame rate because of the amount of objects that were shown on the screen at once. Its a graphic sacrifice to show that many models on one screen. I am eager to see what 343 does with Halo 5, Halo 4 really pushed the limits of the XBox 360 and that was a beautiful game.As of this review I played Infamous SS and I was in love. That game looks incredibly beautiful especially with the recently added feature of taking screen shots within the game bring it to another level. While this was the only exclusive I played on the PS4 as of right now I can say that infamous is one of the best looking games out there now (May 2014). It ran very smooth and the details within the game looked nice and crisp. I loved the detail to how the main character absorbed his powers with the neon lights. An exclusive I look forward to is another Naughty Dog produces, the first being the remastered version of the Last of Us and hopefully a new Uncharted.*Xbox Live and PS Plus*- The Xbox shines in this category because they've been in designing hardware the longest out of the two. Plus even though Playstion owners would bash xbox users for paying for xbox live, that money (or so I hope) was used to create a better service. To make sure it was secure, better connectivity, dedicated servers and market. I still feel like $60 for a year is still of a steep price. But I recommend to those who are looking into getting Xbox Live to always wait for prices drops. You can find Xbox Live deals going for $35-$40 for a year membership. The xbox live market will always be a better market because of the paying members. But like I mentioned earlier the UI designed pulled back xbox live. Going through the market is sometimes slow and the arrangement isn't clean. Xbox Live Gold members as of now have access to demos, streaming services, and games with gold.- PSN Plus and the Playstation store is great, but they will eventually catch up to the level of xbox live due to the growing paying members of plus. The Playstation store has a little learning curve for me coming from the xbox, but it wasn't hard. If anything it was easier to find things and view the different offers in the playstation store. The price for a year is $50 but you can find deals going for $30-$40 at times. The other day during the Watch Dogs release PS store was doing a maintenance. While it was annoying especially during a peak launch of a new game, it gave me confidence that Sony is really trying to develop and improve their online service. Similar to gold, play station does offer free games to plus users.*Overall and final thoughts*Both systems have their pros and cons. Each pro and con can be different to each their own, it really is up to the user on how they are going to use the system and what they prefer. The way I see it as if you prefer the exclusives on the Xbox One, choose the Xbox One. You'll be getting a system that has their great line up of exclusives, Dead Rising 3, Halo 5, Sunset Overdrive, etc. Plus a system that really provides entertainment through media apps and if you plug in your tv. Tie that with kinect using voice command, its a nice set. But thats if you purchase the console with kinect since in June they will be releasing a Xbox One without kinect at $399. I took that drop as a slap to the face from microsoft who were early adopters, plus xbox live gold, and the additional accessories.If exclusives aren't a big deal to you and you're just an average user I would say to choose the PS4. You'll have a slightly better looking multi-platform games, plus PS4's great exclusives. You can still use the console for media such as Netflix, Amazon Instant and more.But for those who are looking for a ""gaming"" console, I honestly would go for the PS4. This system really feels like its designed towards video games. Microsoft in my opinion lost the vision of being a ""gaming console"" by adding kinect and focusing on being an all in one system. Sony took a great direction with the PS4 and I am look forward to its future and games. Just remember their isn't a right side, it goes back on how you use your console and what you're looking out of it.For me the Playstation 4 fits my preference and use. It's at a great price, a good line of of exclusives, slightly better multi-platform games, overall a better value.","05 29, 2014",A2Y49KA0M7XKQD,Alex E.,Xbox user who officially switched to PS4,1401321600

B00IKNDDNK,Electronics,"[20, 24]",1,"Update 6 July 2014:  I am now about to send back my THIRD Fenix2 unit due to the myriad of problems.  This third unit, like the first, randomly subtracted 51 minutes from my elapsed time during the middle of a 3.5 hour run.  My last unit locked up anytime I tried to navigate and crashed during my last 100 miler, making it unusable for the last 50 miles.  With this, my THIRD Fenix2 unit in three months, I have never had a single week of training without a glitch, dropped sensors, lockups, dropped breadcrumb trail or the like.  Perhaps 4th time's a charm?  The only thing less reliable than the watch is Garmin's tech support, who continually says ""wow, we've never heard of that happening before.""  Bullpucky.  The forums are littered with people with tons of problems and no love from Garmin.  This watch is a joke.  A mean one.------------PRIOR REVIEW:  I've had it less than a month, and and had no fewer than eight unique and serious lockup or totally whacky failures with it. I will note that if I do an activity for an hour or two, no issues. It's when you `push' the thing on a 4/5/6+ hour run that it fails in some manner more times than not. Here's an example of what you too can experience on a long run, which is what happened to me on my 100k trail race (running) yesterday, even with Garmin's 'stable' v2.9 update:1. Around an hour and fifty minutes (1:50), the heart rate monitor and the footpod were lost. This is a common occurrence with this watch.2. About 30 min later, the entire watch locked up. While running (during the race, damnit), I pressed and held the light key to shut it off, then on again. When it came back on, the HR and footpod were reading again, and the elapsed race time seemed to be about right.3. The HR and footpod worked the rest of the race, but the next issue was so totally ridiculous that I'm still a bit in shock: when the elapsed time on the watch would get up to about 3:30, it would then drop down something around 2:15, and then continue to add time until the mid-three hour point, then, and I saw it with my own eyes, drop down to the low two hour point. It continued to do this cycle the entire 11 hours I was racing. I am seriously not making this up. I have pictures and video to prove it from the end of the race (because seriously, no one runs 100k/62 miles with 12k feet in elevation gain in under 5 hours), but that's what this ridiculous watch reported in the elapsed time field.4. The map page showed an arrow where I was, but... no track laid down. Nothing. Which kinda made it useless for navigating.Summary: $400 fitness GPS watch that cannot consistently report back on fitness, doesn't function as a GPS, and apparently can't even be relied on as a stopwatch.From what I've seen, I really do think you need to be doing 3+ hour runs (or whatever) to see the consistent, regular failures of this thing. If all you do is train for one or two hours (which is fine, that's not a judgment), then it might work for you. Maybe.","05 11, 2014",A3R7WYJ7AI0IUK,Ken Zemach,Serious endurance athletes: DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH.,1399766400

It works very well for this.Pros:Long battery life.Very comfortable (often times forget I'm wearing them).The sound is clear and does not drop out.Switching from music to phone call, back to music works without issue.Buttons are easily accessible while in use.Cons:The volume control on the device is not fine enough and was almost a deal breaker.  At level 0 it is silent and level 1 can be too loud at times.  I now use an app called Fine Volume Control V2 from the Android store that allows me to adjust between 0 - 1.  I think this is an Android issue vs a problem with the design of the headset.  You'll need to use the software to &#34;fine tune&#34; the volume and not the hardware buttons.  This took a little getting used to but now I'm used to it.  I combined this app with a profile app (Locale) so when my phone detects a connection with these headphones, the volume is automatically adjusted to my desired volume level.The magnets for holding the ear-buds while not in use are not that strong.  It's easy for them to disconnect.When I use it for voice activated dialing, it has a problem understanding me.  It rarely gets the phone number correct.

B00BMQ3KUI,Electronics,"[0, 0]",4,"I had three bits of disappointment with this enclosure.  I give the enclosure four stars because it does work the way it is supposed to per their documentation.  I can't give it five stars without some improvements.The first disappointment was expected based on other reviews.  The enclosure is not made to be reopened.  However, the first enclosure I received would not charge.  After talking to Macally Technical and Customer support I returned the enclosure and received a new one, which works perfectly.  But most important, since I wanted to remove my drive before returning the enclosure, I found that if you are careful you can open the enclosure without breaking it!  I wouldn't do it more than once, though.The second bit of disappointment isn't Macally's fault.  My iTunes library is almost 1TB and I had considered using this enclosure with a 1TB drive as my iTunes drive.  That idea works OK with my Macbook Pro, but it won't work with my iPhone or iPad because of the way iTunes stores files on the i-devices.  So instead I have two folders on this drive.  One contains my favorite MP3s and the other movies that do not have DRM.  This format works with the i-devices using the Macally iOS app.  I don't store documents on this drive because I find that the cloud (I use a few but primarily Dropbox) works for that purpose.The last bit of disappointment is the ethernet port.  It would be nice if this port had some real use.  However, it serves one purpose and that is to use the enclosure as a Wifi hot spot.  You connect the ethernet port to whatever Internet access you have, say in your hotel room when traveling, and you now have a hotspot.  Since I already use my iPhone as a hot spot when I travel, primarily to avoid the ridiculous rates hotels charge, I don't see the purpose.  But my disappointment is that an ethernet connection should be faster than the USB 3.0 one for transferring files.  However, the ethernet port can't be used for transferring files.  The drive does not operate as a NAS drive while connected this way.  This isn't really surprising considering the price.One comment on the provided Mac app.  When I first installed the app on my Macbook Pro, the app would not connect to the drive.  After some major frustration I discovered the problem (not documented) was that my Macbook Pro was ethernet attached to my home network, and I could not have both that connection and the Macally drive connected via WiFi at the same time.  Disconnecting the ethernet cable from my laptop solved this problem.  Since I use the drive for my i-devices this isn't a problem for me.  The app is used to customize the drives WiFi settings and that is all I have used it for.","03 18, 2014",A91GHVY343J44,"Jerome Vitner ""rdolivaw""",Does what it is advertised to do,1395100800

B00FEE7B1I,Electronics,"[3, 3]",4,"First of all, this is a well-made, high quality tablet. Display quality is sharp and colors are vivid.  It has the full Windows 8.1 operating system, not Windows RT, which means you can load regular Windows software just like a regulars Windows 8.1 desktop or laptop computer.  It boots up quickly, apps and programs load very fast.  With an OTG cable, you can connect USB devices such as a thumb drive or wireless mouse.  You can also connect larger peripherals as well such as as an external hard driver or DVD player (though you will probably need a powered USB hub for the large devices such as these, as the tablet's internal power isn't sufficient.).  Microsoft Office Student and Teacher edition is included at no extra cost, making this a great little computer that you can actually do real work with while on the go.That's the good.  Now for the bad.  Putting it simply, many of the Windows 8 apps are just plain terrible, lacking in key features.  Take the Kindle app for Windows 8, for example.  I can only download my Kindle books, not Kindle periodicals or magazines.  C'mon, Amazon, you can do better than that.  My whole purpose for having a Kindle app on a tablet is so that I can read magazines in color and look a the pictures i.e. have a more traditional magazine reading experience.  I don't read books on my Kindle app.  I have my dedicated Kindle e-reader for that purpose.  I can download magazines to my Android tablet as well as my Ipod touch.  Other apps, such as the Fox News app for Windows 8, look like they were just thrown together as an afterthought.  When I open a video in Fox News, it causes Internet explorer to boot up side by size, cutting the screen size of the app in half, presenting a disjointed experience.  What's up with that? I find myself ignoring the app all together and just accessing the Fox News web site.  I could go on.  So, my beef is not with the tablet, or Windows 8 per se, but with the writers of the apps for this platform.  Maybe these apps will improve over time, but for now, I won't be putting my old Android tablet up for sale on Ebay anytime soon.","02 4, 2014",A2YOH5RMY3PBYO,Earle S. Greene,Very nice tablet.

B00HRLSSKO,Electronics,"[10, 10]",4,"As a college student on a budget, I really needed a computer that would do many tasks on the road without hurting the wallet. I have a prehistoric 7-8 year old Dell Dimension E510 desktop that is super slow. So, I made the decision to buy a laptop under $400 yet still faster than my desktop.I set my eyes on this laptop from a local electronics store. I compared specs, from the size and weight, to the nitty features like the number of USBs. And so, here I have it.Let's start off with the design.The design of this notebook is, well, plastic. However, it isn't cheap plastic. The materials used are actually pretty good for its price point. The notebook is nice and rounded around the corners and the thickness of this notebook is about one inch. Now, most notebooks for this price point would be much thicker...Around 1.3in-1.4in, but Dell managed to squeeze everything in 1 inch. This is pretty darn good considering the tools this notebook provides. On the left side of the computer you have a headphone/microphone jack, 3 USB (2 USB 3.0) (1 USB 2.0), Ethernet, HDMI cable, and a power outlet. On the left side you have the optical drive and one more USB port (2.0). So the total amount of USBs this notebook has is 4. 4 USB ports, 2 of which are 3.0. USB 3.0 is relatively new for the market, and this allows much quicker transfer speeds compared to the 2.0s. However, most computers at this price point do not have USB 3.0s, or if they do, it would only be one or two. But keep in mind that this notebook has 4 USB ports. And at this price point, most if not all computers only have about 2 or 3. The optical drive is also a neat feature. For a 1 inch laptop that has an optical drive is pretty impressive considering the price. Most notebooks that are 1 inch or less usually skip the optical drive. Now, the bad thing about the thinness of this notebook is that it does not have a VGA port. You might need a HDMI to VGA port adapter for that. However, considering VGA's thickness and the thinness of notebooks that are coming out each year, VGA is bound to be obsolete due to the benefits of HDMI.On the interior, the notebook has a LARGE track pad. And this is good especially when it is running on windows 8 (I'll get to that later).Below the track pad, there are two left and right buttons. These buttons feel and sound cheap but that is not to be unexpected. When running, the track pad get quite warm. You really can't fault the computer for this because this is a one inch notebook. Since the ram sticks are essentially below the track pad, prepare yourself to have warm fingers. The keyboard is an island style keyboard that are evenly spaced. The key travel is okay. After writing a 5-6 page essay. It's also got a 10 key number pad. However, I do wish that number lock had a tiny light located on the button like the caps lock does. As I'm typing, I sometimes reach over to the number lock while attempting to backspace. One minor complaint is keyboard flex towards the F8-F10 keys, not a big deal since these keys aren't often used. Also, like other reviewer have mentioned before. This computer has a sharp lip. As you are typing, the sharp lip is somewhat irritating. Doesn't hurt to take out a fine grit sand paper is smooth out that lip.Lastly, the spacing between the keys have a glossy finish. I notice that this attracts dust and requires occasional cleaning.As for the hardware,You get 500gb of storage but only 456gb of that storage is usable (the non-usable storage has to be used for the operating system. It runs on 4gb of ram and although it is sufficient, you may want to upgrade to 6 or 8 gigs of ram as you load more programs. But if you're an average web browser, 4 gigs is good enough. To just give you a idea at idle, it is using about 46% of the computers ram. The computer has one extra slot. [edit] The computer will accept 16gb of ram storage. I would suggest throwing in another 4gb as it will give you extra performance due to the dual channel configuration. After removing all the bloatware and Windows finally settled in after dozens of updates this notebook starts up well under a minute. Considering a startup to be when the computer starts to idle.-by the way, uninstall the additional trial anti-virus. Windows 8 already has Defender and so that antivirus will just eat up your resources, I think it comes with Kaspersky or McAfee-The operating system,Now, I'm coming from Windows XP and 7, to be honest...Windows 8 is actually pretty cool. However, if you're an old geezer who likes the traditional interface, Win 8 probably wouldn't be a great option. Anyway, the big benefit of this laptop that allows you to enjoy Windows 8 without the use of a touch screen is the large track pad. This Dell has a 4 and 1/2 inch track pad and using multi gestures features makes it extremely easy.Of course, you can always disable the Windows 8 start up and have it behave like Windows 7. (Look up Windows 8 RetroUI) Other than that, the OS would definitely benefit with a touch screen but without it the system is still enjoyable.Battery life,On a full charge, I get around three to four hours of regular internet browsing.Now for the thinness of this laptop, this computer has a 4 cell battery vs the 6 cell that are in most laptops. Under intense radio loading such as streaming, it will drop to 2 hours...Maybe 3. Keep in mind; you do not want to torture your batteries. The lithium ion batteries used in modern laptops do not like to be charged and discharged abruptly as this will diminish battery life. But, I'm willing to sacrifice 2 cells for a thinner and lighter laptop than have a big and heavy 6 cell.Screen:15.6 inches, 1366x768 glossy.Screen resolution isn't an issue here since most laptops--especially at this price point, have this type of resolution. The problem I commonly have is the viewing angles. This Dell uses a TNF panel, which is offers a distortion of colors when it isn't at the right angle.As for the glossy finish, well, it sucks. It still amazes me why computer corporations still use a glossy finish. The glossy finish and the bad viewing angles makes it somewhat of an unpleasant experience.The WLED screen is bright but the colors could use more saturation.Webcam:It is equipped with a 1 megapixel camera.After using Skype, the picture quality is pretty good.If I compared it with my other Lenovo G560 which has a 0.3 megapixel camera, the difference is like light and day.ProcessorOkay, so it doesn't have TurboBoost or 4-way processing.I have using an Intel Pentium Processor on a Lenovo notebook on Windows 7 and it's pretty good. It gets through most tasks however you must know your limitations.Considering the computers size, weight, and battery configuration, the processor is clocked at 1.9ghz on dual core. I have previously used a Pentium 4 @ 3GHz (a single core processor) and this laptop is significantly faster considering the dual core. Out of box, it scored a 4.7 on the Windows Experience Index. After everything got settled in with the way I liked it, it dropped to a 4.6. Using my way of testing the processor speed, I calculated Pi (Using SuperPi) to one million digits and it did it in 21 seconds. Not bad considering my Dell Desktop does it in 43 seconds... It handles HD streaming off YouTube without problems however when you stream in 720p you CPU usage hovers around 35-60%. Yet, doesn't give you a lot of room of other tasks.Gaming? Well, not much. Don't expect to play WoW or Crisis. It should handle basic games.This processor is equipped with Intel HD Ivy Bridge graphics. Very similar to Intel HD 2000.I was able to play RuneScape on the highest screen settings (other than full screen) with the use of their client rather than the browser. The CPU usage hovers around 80-90%. Game play was still smooth considering it is a 3D game. However, with 80-90% usage, again, does not leave much room for other tasks.Upgrades:The only upgrades you can do to this laptop is RAM and hard drive. The stock hard drive runs at 5400rpm and although it is pretty quick, a solid state would be pointless because you'd be most likely dissatisfied with SSD's price and storage (until they get cheaper). If 500gb is too little, a 7200 rpm hard drive won't hurt.The computer comes with 4gb of ram. Although this is sufficient for basic tasks, it isn't configured as dual channel. Filling that extra DIMM slot will give you better memory storage as well as graphics performance. So why not do it?The CPU/Processor--unfortunately, cannot be upgraded. This is because it is a Ultra Low Voltage Processor (ULV) that is soldered onto the motherboard. This is a big down side since later down the road, you can't upgrade to a used processor at a significantly low price.It's portable, offers a large track pad, good keys, and is loaded with 4 USBs and an optical drive @ just one inch. Overall, this is a great laptop but I wouldn't consider this to be a everyday user. (I use it as a primary since I'm coming from a prehistoric computers, in fact this computer is twice as fast than my old desktop) The processor is the caveat. If you have the option, go for their higher end ""i Series"" of Intel Core Processors.-UPDATE-I reran the Windows Experience Index (WEI) and it jumped from a 4.6 to a 5.1. I guess Windows obtained a better score after removing bloatware and installing the latest drivers. Additionally, a dual channel RAM configuration will allow a slight bump in graphics performance.So here are the subscores that the WEI came up with:Processor: 5.9Memory (RAM): 7.7 &lt;-- I upgraded to 8gbGraphics: 4.6 to 5.1 &lt;-- Graphics performance increases due to a 8gb dual channel configuration, Base score determined by lowest subscore.Gaming graphics: 6.2Primary hard disk: 5.9The WEI scores are based on a scale of 1.0-9.9-Update 2-This would probably fall under build quality. Earlier today I found a missing screw lying on my desk when plugging the notebook for charging. It turns out that this screw was one of the missing screws that was attached to the bottom of the notebook. I was thinking, ""lucky me, good thing I didn't lose it"". So I screwed it back and, and while I was at it I went ahead and checked the rest of the screws. It turns out that all of the screws were not secured tightly (about 2-3 rotations loose). Although they had blue loctite on them, it was not firmly screwed on. Keep in mind, I did not touch any of these screws other than the RAM slot panels which were already secured. I don't know if it just my computer or an entire batch, but a simple production step like secured screws worries me.I would drop a star off my rating (3 stars), but I'm relatively satisfied with my purchase.-Update 3-Running Windows 8.1! The transition was almost flawless except that there was a program I had to uninstall (w/ a little difficulty).Windows 8.1 makes the non-touch situation seem more enjoyable.Couple of complaints is that the two finger tap stopped functioning even after installing the latest drivers designed specifically for 8.1. Sleep functions seems to be a hit and miss as well. Windows 8 slept fine, but 8.1 won't sleep when the computer idles. While searching around the internet, this seems to be a fault by Microsoft and not Dell.If you can live through those gripes, upgrade to 8.1.-Update 4-Now running Windows 8.1 Update 1 (8.1.1). Microsoft added several features that makes Win8 more barable with a keyboard and mouse. Highly reccomended if you already updated to 8.1, get the Update 1.","05 22, 2014",AYANKSMR7OVJX,YourName,Good value (w/ Win8 is more bearable with 8.1.1),1400716800

There is an insulative foam on the plastic ring that makes it too fat to fit under the clips on the headphone chassis. No problem. I removed the thickness and the plastic ring left behind was almost exactly the same thickness as the originals. After making this modification, I lined up the connection, and there was about 1/8&#34; of hard plastic sticking out past the edge of the headphone chassis.Basically, you can get 3/4 of the perimeter clipped in, as the spare material piles up and will not go into place. I need to remove a ring of plastic from around the entire circumference of the replacement pads. I have not been able to do it yet, but i need to take a fingernail clippers and probably a small file and remove this material from the entire earpads.I am assuming that i can hack these and make them work, but not without at least one hour of work. The fitment is completely wrong, and that makes this bargain much more hassle that it is worth. If you are going to produce cheap knockoffs to capitalize on the replacement parts market, at least trace the original better. I expect that this pad was made for some other bose headphones with a bit different dimensions. For me to have to modify the thickness as well as the circumference is just too far from the original.Most likely, they sold me something designed for the QC line or some other bose headphones... though i ordered the TP-1 unit and it was packaged and labled as the TP-1 unit. I would literally not buy another bluecell product in my life.","02 7, 2014",AZ96TOZ1TFI0C,"Michael P.

B003EB03OK,Electronics,"[0, 0]",5,"- I installed this for an older person who enjoys over the air television, but does not have any other form of television programming.. I replaced a 1950's television antenna with this model.  This location is a significant distance from the tv translators.  The antenna is approximately 25 feet above ground level, on a mast.  I run new RG6 cable in to building, and then split to two different tvs.  Did the channel scan and every channel 70 - 95% signal, without any amplifier.. This was impressive, as most of their channels were not pulling 20% before.  This being both UHF and VHF, it's covering both digital bands for today.  They couldn't be happier.  Antenna appears to be of good solid quality.  This install is much farther away from the tv transmit towers than what this antenna is rated for.  All the tv transmitters are located in same location, so once this one was aimed it covered them all.  That is something to keep in mind what doing an antenna.. You may have many located around you in different directions.. When you can get a quality antenna like this, in this smaller size, there is no reason to buy anything bigger or more expensive.  Our cable run wasn't too long, so we chose to not do an amp.. With the signal's in the 80's and 90's % saw no reason for it..  I would recommend this antenna to anyone looking for a good quality antenna.  Just remember this antenna mounts on mast in the center of antenna body.. You need to be able to have an open mast, like above a roof for this to mount right.. Channel master makes an edge mount antenna, so you can mount antenna on like a dish tv mount on a side of a structure...","05 3, 2014",A1VAHHH2RVG6V3,Jason Brent,- Excellent antenna for Rural Location,1399075200

Not only will it convert ATSC signals, but it also provides an HDMI and component output with excellent picture quality. However, on the down side, the remote is very awkward to use, often requiring several key presses to do a simple task-very tedious. Remote operation can lock up and it's functions are not intuitive. It often fails to record as scheduled, and sometimes it will stop recording after a few minutes, while at other times, it records as planned. I've tried various recording media with the same result. I've also tried two HomeWorx units and they share the same faults and attributes. I returned the Viewtv unit and may do the same with the HomeWorx units. These different brands also seem to share the same electronics which may explain why I experienced the same characteristics with both brands. Now, other features that are hard to deal with: A 24 hour clock; Recording names are by date and time only, not the show's name; Odd, remote function names that make for awkward use.

B00ACYTWFI,Electronics,"[0, 0]",5,"I bought this because I have an old 50mm f/1.8 FD lens lying around and I figured why not? What I didn't realize is how awesome the EOS-M and an FD lens + adaptor would be. I have an FD adaptor for my other EF mount cameras which uses an optical element in the adaptor to enlarge the image due to the fact that the adaptor moves the lens further from the sensor. This can of course degrade or distort the image. Because the EOS-M has a shorter flange distance and needs to move any EF, EF-S or FD lens further away from the sensor anyway so this adaptor does not need the optical element.If you want to shoot video with your EOS-M then you might already be willing to pay $100s for a lens with a &#34;de-clicked&#34; aperture and manual focus. It's fairly easy to de-click many of the FD lens's and with this adaptor you can start using old and in expensive FD lenses for manual video. My 50mm looks great, though you will want to add a variable ND filter if you want to shoot wide open in bright light.","01 16, 2014",A27RIKJSPFF2J1,Pcmofo,Perfect for video,1389830400
B000EOSHGQ,Electronics,"[3, 4]",5,I heard some negative reviews about the auto focus of this lens. The thing is the lens focuses as to what it is programed to a certain area as per the camera settings. The pictures are super sharp when used properly and if you use a single point of focus it works fine. The camera can not judge what you are thinking so you must make the proper settings when composing the picture.  I generally don't shoot close-ups at F2.8 anyway and try to use a larger depth of field using aperture control which yields some great picture.,"03 6, 2014",A1JTEMXLNCUZ0V,"T.

I'm really in love with theVIZIO 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED HDTVbecause it meets an outstanding value in terms of features when compared to price.First things first, the TV has amazing aesthetics.  The Vizio features a super slim bezel, that means I'm looking at more TV space and less plastic surround.  1080P in this price range is not too easy to find so another score there.  Much better 120Hz refresh rate, my old one had only 60Hz.  LED is fantastic, and energy saving, much more vibrant than LCD too.  Love the 10,000,000:1 contrast, a tremendous upgrade to 10,000:1 dynamic my older model used.Getting into the users experience, the Vizio 40"" is a good size for the bedroom, office, or smaller living room.  Love the built-in Wi-Fi for connectivity to all the apps in the Vizio store.  I wish this model had a built-in web browser, but I have a tablet that is great for that.  If you use and subscribe to Netflix, the TV remote has a dedicated button directly to the service.  In terms of connectivity, you have 3 HDMI ports for your gaming stations, DVD/Blu-Ray player, sound system or whatever else you may use.The picture quality is really amazing; clear, crisp and wonderful.  Sound is really good, the 2 10W speakers are powerful and full sounding.  This TV gives new meaning to entertainment center.

We were using his regular PC to log into both his school and regular google accounts, but chrome delightfully synchronized all of his bookmarks from his regular account to his school account, and his teacher thought he was playing minecraft at school because it was in his bookmarks bar.So a little separation of the two seemed like a good idea.This chromebook has the latest intel cpu so its fast AND has long battery life.  The ARM cpu based units have the battery life but not the speed, and models like the C710 have the older intel cpu with good speed, but short battery life.  One thing the C710 has is some amount of upgrade potential but it requires a pretty heavy disassembly process.  This unit can't really be upgraded.Its thin, light, has a good enough screen and as long as you're okay with doing stuff in a chrome browser or with google apps, its a fully functional lightweight laptop.

The thing is, though, these are some great sounding headphones.The large bass driver does not overpower the balanced armature drivers. Treble is silky smooth, reminding me quite a bit of the classic Sennheiser sound. Mid's are present and not over powering. I've thrown a lot of different music at these things over the past month, and I've been consistently pleased with the sound.The cords are a strange beast. They have a very thick and semi flexible ear loop. Once you get them molded to your ears, they tend to remain in place. If you wear glasses, the thick cables will be in the way.Changing the headphones for the microphone cable is a pain. Once you change the wires, you have to make them mold to your ears again.

B004P15HD0,Electronics,"[0, 0]",5,"I have an outstanding Denon A/V receiver and excellent Definitive speakers but needed headphones to keep from disturbing another party in the house late at night.  I had concerns about the sound quality of most of the items on the market but have always valued Sony products so I thought I would give these a shot.To my delight, they provide outstanding reproduction.  The sound is crisp, clear and rich.  What we fail to realize is that today's TV and DVD content is loaded with detailed sound.  Speakers, no matter how good, are dissipating the sound throughout the room.  Detail is inevitably missed.  As with music, headphones make a huge difference for TV and video.  These are very comfortable to wear.  The setup took about 30 seconds and the charge seems to last plenty long.Even though these are discontinued and an older model, they are great and I urge anyone to order them without delay, if, and it is a big if,  your receiver, cable box, dvr or other source has a digital optical audio output.  These headphones have only one digital setup option:  optical cable.  Most new receivers no longer have an optical audio output.  My great 2 year old Denon receiver didn't.I couldn't even find a new higher end A/V receiver to buy that had an optical audio output.  I feared that I was going to have to set the phones up using analog connections which I really did not want to do.Then I had an inspiration to look at the back of my TIVO Premiere XL.  Sure enough, it had an optical output.  The Sony transmitter connected immediately and the sound was perfect.  Better still, the Sony headphones set up this way operate independently of theTV audio simultaneously coming out of my Denon receiver.  The volume of each can be controlled independently and there is no delay between the two audio tracks.  Perfect!Sony's new model of this item comes with an HDMI connection making life much easier.  However, those phones are more that $400 even on Amazon.  I usually spare no expense but that number gave me some pause as I had no idea what the sound quality would be using those phones.  The MDRDS6500 worked out perfectly.  Check for that optical output and buy these while they are still available!","04 25, 2014",AGEAN29UKSZGM,rgj21,Outstanding Wireless Headphones--with one big caveat,1398384000

I'm willing to pay for all those engineering hours that went into making a product that just works.Why only 4 stars? Sirius does drop out every now and then. And I do wish Sonos was clearer about how the Connect fits into the picture. I would have bought this a lot earlier and saved myself a lot of time playing around with other solutions.There seems to be a lot of marketing and instructions regarding the Sonos Play devices, but not much about this one. For example, I had thought using Sonos would require me to ditch my current audio system and move completely to their speakers because pretty much every solution they showed had a few of those Sonos speakers sprinkled in. Also, I wish they had it in black so that it blended in better with my other audio equipment.I had a few questions about the system and my local Best Buy guys couldn't answer them. I could tell they were just making up stuff and hoping I wouldn't ask more questions. For example, they were convinced I needed a bridge (wrong) and that the Connect was basically a router and that I would need a computer on at all times in order to make this work (also wrong).So, I emailed Sonos directly (they have their email listed on the Support section of their website). Within a few hours I had the answers I needed to make my decision. That's good customer service right there- I wasn't yet a customer, and yet they were very prompt about helping me make the right choices. Sonos didn't try to sell me things I didn't need. Very impressive.My current setup:-Pioneer Elite SC-75 receiver-Martin Logan EM-ESL speakers-Dynamo 700 sub-MyCloud (all my music files are on the MyCloud) connected via Ethernet cable directly to the router-Sonos Connect (without the amp feature because I use wired speakers to my Pioneer receiver)-I do not have any other Sonos components (no Bridge, no Sonos speakers, just the Connect only)-I do not leave a computer running to work with this system-My wireless router is right by the Sonos: the Connect is connected directly to the router by Ethernet cableThe questions I had were (paraphrased):Question:If I use my iPad to control the Connect music lists (kick off a playlist, play Sirius, etc.) does the iPad need to remain on if no music files are being used from it.Answer: All of the programming stays on the Connect itself. You can basically turn off the iPad completely and the Connect will work just fine once you've started your music. You'll need to make sure if you are playing music files that the source for those files is accessible. So, if you do have your music on your iPad or computer, that needs to stay on so the Connect can access the files and play them.Question: I really like my DAC on the Pioneer Elite SC-75 and want to use it instead of the DAC in the Connect. How do I do that?Answer: If you use a digital optical cable out from the Connect and into the Pioneer, the signal remains digital and the DAC on the Pioneer will do the conversion.  If you use the RCA connectors out of the Connect and into the Pioneer, the signal is converted from digital to analog by the Connect DAC. The RCA cable was included. If you want to use digital optical, you'll need to buy one.Question: Do I need to buy a bridge?Answer: No. You can connect your Connect by using an Ethernet cable right to the router.As long as your controller software (in my case, the iPad) can communicate with the same network that the Connect is on, you're fine. You only need the bridge if you cannot connect your Connect directly to the router or if you need to communicate to other Sonos components (like Sonos speakers) that are not connected to the router via Ethernet. The controller (in my case, iPad) never communicates using the wireless connection that is used between the Bridge and the Sonos components. It just goes across the regular wireless that you have going on in your house. For me, I have the Connect plugged directly into my NightHawk wireless router and that's the same router that serves the wireless connection for my iPad. Works perfectly. And they do include the Ethernet cable right in the box.","01 12, 2014",A29ZTDC81NUR6C,CBMusika,It just works!,1389484800

If you're looking for amazing sound quality and something you can drop in the pool and take to the beach... oh yeah, I also want it for under $100! Yeah, I would look elsewhere (you'll probably look for a long time too).I bought this for music by the pool (on the ledge) and on the boat (while floating around), it is perfect for those two things.Clearly the fact that its waterproof and can't have full sound ducts limits its low-end (bass) sound, but I'm willing to trade off perfect sound for utility and endurance.Here are the great parts... the bluetooth is extremely easy to pair and the connection is solid (way better than a unit I had that was 3 times the price). I paired this thing with my iphone 5 and walked around the house and it never broke a connection. I know BT speakers/headsets that break when it's windy!You don't have to worry at all about this thing, it's great. You charge it, pair it and you have music in a localized area anywhere you want? Leave your phone in the house or below deck and control (skip tracks/ pause/take calls) above deck or poolside where it's wet and wild.I had very high overall expectations for this (but still skeptical about the sound because of the physical limitions e.g. size, mobility, ruggedness), but this thing is dead on what I need. It helps that its priced reasonably too!If you're going to be an audio snob, keep looking. Also, if you think this thing is going to be loud enough for a BBQ party with 30 people talking over it, you'll be disappointed too. if you're ok with some decent sounding tunes, this is an awesome/fun product!P.S. as a general rule I never try to let anything with a lithium-ion battery get extremely hot (cell phone, tablet, this thing, gps) so I try to keep it out of direct sun if I can, just to make the battery chemicals last longer.

B00HNJWSH4,Electronics,"[4, 5]",5,"I primarily use this camera on my road bike handlebar. For this use case, I'm calling the Sony AS100 the best action camera on the market because the image quality is great and the image stabilization works well. This is the only action camera that I have seen with built-in image stabilization and that feature makes a huge difference when bicycling. Even when bicycling on good quality roads, there are enough bumps to make the video unpleasant to watch without image stabilization. The in-camera image stabilization works great for me, giving me much better results than the Adobe Premier stabilization filter, which take forever to run in addition to producing unsatisfactory results.I have also used Sony's previous action camera, the AS30. That model also has image stabilization and generally works OK, but has enough quirks to make the total experience less than idea. Most importantly, the AS100 has noticeably improved image quality, with clearer images as well as better color and contrast. Some other improvements that I immediately noticed:1. With the AS30, the only way to tell if the camera was shooting is to look at the small LCD screen on the side of the camera, which is hard to do when you are riding your bicycle. The AS100 now has red LEDs on the top and back of the camera to easily tell your if the camera is shooting. This is a huge improvement for me. With the AS30, I missed many shots because I thought the camera was on when it was not.2. With the AS30, you have to put the camera in the clunky underwater case before attaching it to your bicycle or helmet. With the helmet mount, this can be uncomfortable because of the weight of the case. The AS100 now includes a lightweight, but still secure, holder for use with all mounts.3. In addition to reducing weight and bulk, this holder also lets you replace the camera battery without removing the camera from the case. You can also access the USB port (for downloading video and/or recharging) without removing the holder. Without the case, the camera is less protected, but that's not a big deal for my uses (the camera will probably become obsolete before I crash with it).4. Possibly because I'm not longer using the waterproof case all the time, the AS100 camera lens seems to pick up much less glare than the AS30. With the AS30, shooting in the direction of the sun usually produced worthless videos because of glare. This no longer seems to be a problem with the AS100, at least so far.5. The AS30 already had great audio (for an action camera), but the AS100 is noticeably better. I notice much less wind noise with the Sony cameras than with other brands. The AS100 seems clearer to me with with regard to other audio input like conversations and bicycle mechanical sounds.","05 1, 2014",A33YZNZIRA3H97,l2,best action camera if you want to mount on a bicycle handlebar,1398902400

I bought a different stick of 4 gigabyte Crucial Brand RAM on the Crucial website.  I looked up the motherboard I had on the Crucial web site and matched it with the type of RAM I needed for my motherboard.  My 4gb stick of Crucial RAM works great and is inexpensive for the amount I got.My hardware configuration is : (motherboard) gigabyte H81M-HD2, (processor) 1150 socket Celeron G1820 Haswell, 4 gigabytes of crucial brand RAM, SATA 3 Kingston 60gigabyte SSD, HP DVD burner, 550 Watt PSU ""ultra"" brand.

B008PQAB3C,Electronics,"[1, 1]",5,"I shopped around for a bookshelf system I could hear in my woodshop over the sound of the power tools. This system really does the job. The quality of the sound is great. I have Bose speakers in my home theater and although the Denon system does not have nearly as much wattage, the sound quality is comparable. This is not to say it is not loud enough. I don't know how high the volume level goes, but most of the time I listen to music at about 18 or 20. 25 is loud, 30 is rocking loud and 40 is high enough to hear the music with ear plugs and the table saw running. Not the cheapest bookshelf system, but certainly one of the best sounding.Just be aware you need at least a 10&#34; wide shelf for the speakers and a 12&#34; shelf for the receiver. My speakers are about six feet apart mounted on shelves about seven feet high and they sound fantastic.","06 3, 2014",AFJOSH1UTYUAK,"Amazon Customer ""Gadget Guy""","Excellent system, small footprint",1401753600
